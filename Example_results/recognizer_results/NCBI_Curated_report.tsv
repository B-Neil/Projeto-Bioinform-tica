YbbF/LpxH is an Escherichia coli UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase thought to catalyze the fourth step of lipid A biosynthesis, in which a precursor UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine is hydrolyzed to yield 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate and UMP.  YbbF belongs to the metallophosphatase (MPP) superfamily.  MPPs are functionally diverse, but all share a conserved domain with an active site consisting of two metal ions (usually manganese, iron, or zinc) coordinated with octahedral geometry by a cage of histidine, aspartate, and asparagine residues. The MPP superfamily includes: Mre11/SbcD-like exonucleases, Dbr1-like RNA lariat debranching enzymes, YfcE-like phosphodiesterases, purple acid phosphatases (PAPs), YbbF-like UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolases, and acid sphingomyelinases (ASMases).  The conserved domain is a double beta-sheet sandwich with a di-metal active site made up of residues located at the C-terminal side of the sheets. This domain is thought to allow for productive metal coordination.		CDD:277343			22.134	253.0	158.0	8.0	3.0	252.0	1.0	217.0	3.48e-44	147.0

ACS forms a heterotetramer with carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) consisting of two ACS and two CODH subunits. CODH reduces carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and ACS then synthesizes acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide, CoA, and a methyl group donated by another protein (CoFeSP).  ACS has three structural domains, an N-terminal rossman fold domain with a helical region at its N-terminus which interacts with CODH, and two alpha + beta fold domains.  A Ni-Fe-S center referred to as the A-cluster is located in the C-terminal domain. A large cavity exists between the three domains which may bind CoA.

Cobaltochelatase is a complex enzyme that catalyzes the insertion of cobalt into hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, resulting in cobyrinic acid, as demonstrated for Pseudomonas denitrificans. This is an essential step in the bacterial synthesis of cobalamine (B12). The insertion of cobalt requires a complex composed of three polypeptides, cobN, cobS, and cobT. Also included in this family are protoporphyrin IX magnesium chelatases involved in the synthesis of chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll, specifically the large (chlH or bchH) subunits.They are thought to bind both the protoporphyrin and the magnesium ion. Hydrolysis of ATP by the smaller subunits in the complex may trigger a conformational change that results in the insertion of the ion into the protoporphyrin scaffold. Cryo electron microscopy studies have suggested that a distinct bchH C-terminal domain may bind tightly to the N-terminal domain upon substrate binding, requiring a substantial conformational change of the bchH subunit. It has also been suggested that chlH of higher plants binds abscisic acid via a C-terminal domain and plays a role in abscisic acid signaling, and that the protein spans the chloroplast envelope, with the C-terminus exposed to the cytosol.

tr|A0B7N6|A0B7N6_METTP	cd01335		Radical SAM superfamily. Enzymes of this family generate radicals by combining a 4Fe-4S cluster and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in close proximity. They are characterized by a conserved CxxxCxxC motif, which coordinates the conserved iron-sulfur cluster. Mechanistically, they share the transfer of a single electron from the iron-sulfur cluster to SAM, which leads to its reductive cleavage to methionine and a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, which, in turn, abstracts a hydrogen from the appropriately positioned carbon atom. Depending on the enzyme, SAM is consumed during this process or it is restored and reused. Radical SAM enzymes catalyze steps in metabolism, DNA repair, the biosynthesis of vitamins and coenzymes, and the biosynthesis of many antibiotics. Examples are biotin synthase (BioB), lipoyl synthase (LipA), pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL), coproporphyrinogen oxidase (HemN), lysine 2,3-aminomutase (LAM), anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (ARR), and  MoaA, an enzyme of the biosynthesis of molybdopterin.

tr|A0B7Z8|A0B7Z8_METTP	cd00995		The substrate-binding domain of an ABC-type nickel/oligopeptide-like import system contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding domain of nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide transport systems, which function in the import of nickel and peptides, and other closely related proteins. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is a periplasmic component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system OppABCDEF consisting of five subunits: two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Similar to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems, nickel transporter is comprised of five subunits NikABCDE: the two pore-forming integral inner membrane proteins NikB and NikC; the two inner membrane-associated proteins with ATPase activity NikD and NikE; and the periplasmic nickel binding NikA, which is the initial nickel receptor that controls the chemotactic response away from nickel.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand binding domains of ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

Acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS, EC 6.2.1.1, acetate#CoA ligase or acetate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming)) catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA from acetate, CoA, and ATP. Synthesis of acetyl-CoA is carried out in a two-step reaction. In the first step, the enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of acetyl-AMP intermediate from acetate and ATP. In the second step, acetyl-AMP reacts with CoA to produce acetyl-CoA. This enzyme is widely present in all living organisms. The activity of this enzyme is crucial for maintaining the required levels of acetyl-CoA, a key intermediate in many important biosynthetic and catabolic processes. Acetyl-CoA is used in the biosynthesis of glucose, fatty acids, and cholesterol. It can also be used in the production of energy in the citric acid cycle. Eukaryotes typically have two isoforms of acetyl-CoA synthetase, a cytosolic form involved in biosynthetic processes and a mitochondrial form primarily involved in energy generation.

They are found in multiple intracellular membranes including vacuoles, endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi-derived vesicles, secretory vesicles, as well as the plasma membrane.

This model describes the metallopeptidase M23 family, which includes beta-lytic metallopeptidase and lysostaphin. Members of this family are zinc endopeptidases that lyse bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans; they cleave either the N-acylmuramoyl-Ala bond between the cell wall peptidoglycan and the cross-linking peptide (e.g. beta-lytic endopeptidase) or a bond within the cross-linking peptide (e.g. stapholysin, and lysostaphin). Beta-lytic metallopeptidase, formerly known as beta-lytic protease, has a preference for cleavage of Gly-X bonds and favors hydrophobic or apolar residues on either side. It inhibits growth of sensitive organisms and may potentially serve as an antimicrobial agent. Lysostaphin, produced by Staphylococcus genus, cleaves pentaglycine cross-bridges of cell wall peptidoglycan, acting as autolysins to maintain cell wall metabolism or as toxins and weapons against competing strains. Staphylolysin (also known as LasA) is implicated in a range of processes related to Pseudomonas virulence, including stimulating shedding of the ectodomain of cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycan syndecan-1, and elastin degradation in connective tissue. Its active site is less constricted and contains a five-coordinate zinc ion with trigonal bipyramidal geometry and two metal-bound water molecules, possibly contributing to its activity against a wider range of substrates than those used by related lytic enzymes, consistent with its multiple roles in Pseudomonas virulence.

MMCE has been found in bacteria, archaea, and in animals. In eukaryotes, MMCE is an essential enzyme in a pathway that converts propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, and is important in the breakdown of odd-chain length fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, and other metabolites. In bacteria, MMCE participates in the reverse pathway for propionate fermentation, glyoxylate regeneration, and the biosynthesis of polyketide antibiotics. MMCE is closely related to glyoxalase I and type I extradiol dioxygenases.		CDD:319912			53.543	127.0	59.0	0.0	6.0	132.0	1.0	127.0	1.01e-54	165.0

This family includes the carboxyltransferase domains of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and the transcarboxylase (TC) 5S subunit.  Transcarboxylase 5S is a cobalt-dependent metalloenzyme subunit of the biotin-dependent transcarboxylase multienzyme complex. Transcarboxylase 5S transfers carbon dioxide from the 1.3S biotin to pyruvate in the second of two carboxylation reactions catalyzed by TC. The first reaction involves the transfer of carbon dioxide from methylmalonyl-CoA to the 1.3S biotin, and is catalyzed by the 12S subunit.  These two steps allow a carboxylate group to be transferred from oxaloacetate to propionyl-CoA to yield pyruvate and methylmalonyl-CoA.  The catalytic domain of transcarboxylase 5S has a canonical TIM-barrel fold with a large C-terminal extension that forms a funnel leading to the active site.  Transcarboxylase 5S forms a homodimer and there are six dimers per complex.  In addition to the catalytic domain, transcarboxylase 5S has several other domains including a carbamoyl-phosphate synthase domain, a biotin carboxylase domain, a carboxyltransferase domain, and an ATP-grasp domain.  Pyruvate carboxylase, like TC, is a biotin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate.  In mammals, PC has critical roles in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, glyceroneogenesis, and insulin secretion.  Inherited PC deficiencies are linked to serious diseases in humans such as lactic acidemia, hypoglycemia, psychomotor retardation, and death.  PC is a single-chain enzyme and is active only in its homotetrameric form.  PC has three domains, an N-terminal biotin carboxylase domain, a carboxyltransferase domain (this alignment model), and a C-terminal biotin-carboxyl carrier protein domain.

These members all share a conserved  triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain consisting of a core beta(8)-alpha(8) motif with the eight parallel beta strands forming an enclosed barrel surrounded by eight alpha helices.  The domain has a catalytic center containing a divalent cation-binding site formed by a cluster of invariant residues that cap the core of the barrel.  In addition, the catalytic site includes three invariant residues - an aspartate (D), an arginine (R), and a glutamate (E) - which is the basis for the domain name ""DRE-TIM""."

The N-terminal 150-200 residues form a plug from the periplasmic end of barrel.   Energy (proton-motive force) and TonB-dependent conformational alteration of channel (parts of plug, and loops 7 and 8) allow passage of ligand. FepA residues 12-18 form the TonB box, which mediates the interaction with the TonB-containing  inner membrane complex. TonB preferentially interacts with ligand-bound receptors. Transport thru the channel may resemble passage thru an air lock.  In this model, ligand binding leads to closure of the extracellular end of pore, then a TonB-mediated  signal facillitates opening of the interior side of pore, deforming the N-terminal plug and allowing passage of the ligand to the periplasm.

Type-I LS, also known as RibH1, catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin in plants and microorganisms. LS catalyse the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine by the condensation of 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione with 3,4-dihydroxy- 2-butanone-4-phosphate. Subsequently, the lumazine intermediate dismutates to yield riboflavin and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino- 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, in a reaction catalyzed by riboflavin synthase synthase (RS); RS belongs to a different family of the Lumazine-synthase-like superfamily. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) which are essential cofactors for the catalysis of a wide range of redox reactions. These cofactors are also involved in many other processes involving DNA repair, circadian time-keeping, light sensing, and bioluminescence. Riboflavin is biosynthesized in plants, fungi and certain microorganisms; as animals lack the necessary enzymes to produce this vitamin, they acquire it from dietary sources.

CODH reduces carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and ACS then synthesizes acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide, CoA, and a methyl group donated by another protein (CoFeSP).  ACS has three structural domains, an N-terminal rossman fold domain with a helical region at its N-terminus which interacts with CODH, and two alpha + beta fold domains.  A Ni-Fe-S center referred to as the A-cluster is located in the C-terminal domain. A large cavity exists between the three domains which may bind CoA.		CDD:474039

LysM, a small globular domain with approximately 40 amino acids, is a widespread protein module involved in binding peptidoglycan in bacteria and chitin in eukaryotes. The domain was originally identified in enzymes that degrade bacterial cell walls, but proteins involved in many other biological functions also contain this domain. It has been reported that the LysM domain functions as a signal for specific plant-bacteria recognition in bacterial pathogenesis. Many of these enzymes are modular and are composed of catalytic units linked to one or several repeats of LysM domains. LysM domains are found in bacteria and eukaryotes.

HU is a conserved nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) which binds non-specifically to duplex DNA with a particular preference for targeting nicked and bent DNA. It is highly basic and contributes to chromosomal compaction and maintenance of negative supercoiling, thus often referred to as histone-like protein. HU can induce DNA bends, condense DNA in a fiber and also interact with single stranded DNA. It contains two homologous subunits, alpha and beta, typically forming homodimers (alpha-alpha and beta-beta), except in E. coli and other enterobacteria, which form heterodimers (alpha-beta). In E. coli, HU binds uniformly to the chromosome, with a preference for damaged or distorted DNA structures and can introduce negative supercoils into closed circular DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I. Anabaena HU (AHU) shows preference for A/T-rich region in the center of its DNA binding site.		CDD:259853			60.465	86.0	34.0	0.0	2.0	87.0	1.0	86.0	7.93e-41	127.0

Tpx is a bacterial periplasmic peroxidase which differs from other PRXs in that it shows substrate specificity toward alkyl hydroperoxides over hydrogen peroxide. As with all other PRXs, the peroxidatic cysteine (N-terminal) of Tpx is oxidized into a sulfenic acid intermediate upon reaction with peroxides. Tpx is able to resolve this intermediate by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond with a conserved C-terminal cysteine (the resolving cysteine), which can then be reduced by thioredoxin. This differs from the typical 2-cys PRX which resolves the oxidized cysteine by forming an intermolecular disulfide bond with the resolving cysteine from the other subunit of the homodimer. Atypical 2-cys PRX homodimers have a loop-based interface (A-type for alternate), in contrast with the B-type interface of typical 2-cys and 1-cys PRXs.

NADP binding domain of the Methylene-Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase (m-THF DH/cyclohydrolase) bifunctional enzyme.   Tetrahydrofolate is a versatile carrier of activated one-carbon units. The major one-carbon folate donors are N-5 methyltetrahydrofolate, N5,N10-m-THF, and N10-formayltetrahydrofolate. The oxidation of metabolic intermediate m-THF to m-THF requires the enzyme m-THF DH. In addition, most DHs also have an associated cyclohydrolase activity which catalyzes its hydrolysis to N10-formyltetrahydrofolate. m-THF DH is typically found as part of a multifunctional protein in eukaryotes. NADP-dependent m-THF DH in mammals, birds and yeast are components of a trifunctional enzyme with DH, cyclohydrolase, and synthetase activities. Certain eukaryotic cells also contain homodimeric bifunctional DH/cyclodrolase form. In bacteria, monofucntional DH, as well as bifunctional m-THF m-THF DHm-THF DHDH/cyclodrolase are found. In addition, yeast (S. cerevisiae) also express an monofunctional DH. This family contains the bifunctional DH/cyclohydrolase.

The key physiological role of this enzyme in acetogens is to catalyze the formylation of tetrahydrofolate, an initial step in the reduction of carbon dioxide and other one-carbon precursors to acetate.

Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. For many of these enzymes the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits. However, for the homodimeric enzyme Desulfovibrio africanus pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), each active site lies at the interface of the PYR and PP domains from the same subunit. This subfamily includes proteins characterized as pyruvate NADP+ oxidoreductase (PNO). PFOR and PNO catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA, a crucial step in many metabolic pathways. The facultative anaerobic mitochondrion of the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis oxidizes pyruvate with PNO. IOR catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of arylpyruvates, such as indolepyruvate or phenylpyruvate.		CDD:132917			43.75	160.0	85.0	3.0	12.0	169.0	4.0	160.0	6.48e-58	184.0

PFOR catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA, a crucial step in many metabolic pathways. Archaea, anaerobic bacteria and eukaryotes that lack mitochondria (and therefore pyruvate dehydrogenase) use PFOR to oxidatively decarboxylate pyruvate, with ferredoxin or flavodoxin as the electron acceptor.

They are comprised of a periplasmic substrate-binding protein (SBP; often called the P subunit) and two unequally sized integral membrane components: a large transmembrane subunit involved in the translocation process (the M subunit) and a smaller membrane of unknown function (the Q subunit). The driving force of TRAP transporters is provided by electrochemical ion gradients (either protons or sodium ions) across the cytoplasmic membrane, rather than ATP hydrolysis. This substrate-binding domain belongs to the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily (PBP2).

This is a family of SusD-like proteins, one member of which, BT1043, is an outer membrane lipoprotein involved in host glycan metabolism. The structures of this and SusD-homologs in the family are dominated by tetratrico peptide repeats that may facilitate association with outer membrane beta-barrel transporters required for glycan uptake. The structure of BT1043 complexed with N-acetyllactosamine reveals that recognition is mediated via hydrogen bonding interactions with the reducing end of beta-N-acetylglucosamine, suggesting a role in binding glycans liberated from the mucin polypeptide. Mammalian distal gut bacteria have an expanded capacity to utilize glycans. In the absence of dietary sources, some species rely on host-derived mucosal glycans. The ability of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent human gut symbiont, to forage host glycans contributes to both its ability to persist within an individual host and its ability to be transmitted naturally to new hosts at birth.

Meprins comprise a class of extracellular metalloproteases which are anchored to the membrane and are capable of cleaving growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and biologically active peptides. TRAF molecules serve as adapter proteins that link cell surface receptors of the Tumor Necrosis Factor and 1nterleukin-1/Toll-like families to downstream kinase cascades, which results in the activation of transcription factors and the regulation of cell survival, proliferation and stress responses in the immune and inflammatory systems. Other members include the ubiquitin ligases, TRIM37 and SPOP, and the ubiquitin-specific proteases, HAUSP and Ubp21p. A large number of uncharacterized members mostly from lineage-specific expansions in C. elegans and rice contain MATH and BTB domains, similar to SPOP. The MATH domain has been shown to bind peptide/protein substrates in TRAFs and HAUSP. It is possible that the MATH domain in other members of this superfamily also interacts with various protein substrates. The TRAF domain may also be involved in the trimerization of TRAFs. Based on homology, it is postulated that the MATH domain in meprins may be involved in its tetramer assembly and that the MATH domain, in general, may take part in diverse modular arrangements defined by adjacent multimerization domains.

Bacteria and archaea import molybdenum and tungsten from the environment in the form of the oxyanions molybdate (MoO(4) (2-)) and tungstate (WO(4) (2-)). After binding molybdate with high affinity, they interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase.  This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.

Type-I LS, also known as RibH1, catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin in plants and microorganisms. LS catalyse the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine by the condensation of 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione with 3,4-dihydroxy- 2-butanone-4-phosphate. Subsequently, the lumazine intermediate dismutates to yield riboflavin and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino- 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, in a reaction catalyzed by riboflavin synthase synthase (RS); RS belongs to a different family of the Lumazine-synthase-like superfamily. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) which are essential cofactors for the catalysis of a wide range of redox reactions. These cofactors are also involved in many other processes involving DNA repair, circadian time-keeping, light sensing, and bioluminescence. Riboflavin is biosynthesized in plants, fungi and certain microorganisms; as animals lack the necessary enzymes to produce this vitamin, they acquire it from dietary sources. Type II LSs are distinct from type-I LS not only in protein sequence, but in that they exhibit different quaternary assemblies; type-I LSs form pentamers. The pathogen Brucella spp. encode both a Type-I LS and a Type-II LS called RibH1 and RibH2, respectively.

The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP.

It catalyzes the Mg-ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to yield sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. It also catalyzes the phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone, L-glyceraldehyde and D-glyceraldehyde.  The subfamily includes GKs and GK-like proteins from all three kingdoms of living organisms. Metazoan GKs, coded by X chromosome-linked GK genes, and GK-like proteins, coded by autosomal testis-specific GK-like genes GK2, GK3 and Gykl1 (in mouse) are closely related to the bacterial GKs. The metazoan GKs do have GK enzymatic activity. However, the GK-like metazoan proteins do not exhibit GK activity and their biological functions are not yet clear. Some of them lack important functional residues involved in the binding of ADP and Mg2+, which may result in the loss of GK catalytic function.  Others that have conserved catalytic residues have lost their GK activity as well; the reason remains unclear. It has been suggested the conserved catalytic residues might facilitate them performing a distinct function. Under different conditions, GKs from different species may exist in different oligomeric states. Members of this subfamily belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain.

It contains a Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad and is a member of the peptidase S8 (subtilisin and kexin) family. The catalytic triad is similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but it does not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. Serine acts as a nucleophile, aspartate as an electrophile, and histidine as a base. The S53 family contains a catalytic triad Glu/Asp/Ser with an additional acidic residue Asp in the oxyanion hole, similar to that of subtilisin.  The serine residue here is the nucleophilic equivalent of the serine residue in the S8 family, while glutamic acid has the same role here as the histidine base.   However, the aspartic acid residue that acts as an electrophile is quite different.  In S53, it follows glutamic acid, while in S8 it precedes histidine.

Members of this subfamily contain an N-terminal MCM domain and a C-terminal coenzyme B12 binding domain. MCM catalyzes the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. The reaction proceeds via radical intermediates beginning with a substrate-induced homolytic cleavage of the Co-C bond of coenzyme B12 to produce cob(II)alamin and the deoxyadenosyl radical. MCM plays an important role in the conversion of propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA during the degradation of propionate for the Krebs cycle. In higher animals, MCM is involved in the breakdown of odd-chain fatty acids, several amino acids, and cholesterol. Methylobacterium extorquens MCM participates in the glyoxylate regeneration pathway. In M. extorquens, MCM forms a complex with MeaB; MeaB may protect MCM from irreversible inactivation. In some bacteria, MCM is involved in the reverse metabolic reaction, the rearrangement of succinyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA. Examples include P. shermanni MCM during propionic acid fermentation, E.coli MCM in a pathway for the conversion of succinate to propionate and Streptomyces MCM in polyketide biosynthesis. Sinorhizobium meliloti strain SU47 MCM plays a role in the polyhydroxyalkanoate degradation pathway. P. shermanni and Streptomyces cinnamonensis MCMs are alpha/beta heterodimers. It has been shown for P. shermanni MCM that only the alpha subunit binds coenzyme B12 and substrates. Human MCM is a homodimer with two active sites. Mouse and E.coli MCMs are also homodimers.

This family includes the carboxyltransferase domains of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and the transcarboxylase (TC) 5S subunit.  Transcarboxylase 5S is a cobalt-dependent metalloenzyme subunit of the biotin-dependent transcarboxylase multienzyme complex. Transcarboxylase 5S transfers carbon dioxide from the 1.3S biotin to pyruvate in the second of two carboxylation reactions catalyzed by TC. The first reaction involves the transfer of carbon dioxide from methylmalonyl-CoA to the 1.3S biotin, and is catalyzed by the 12S subunit.  These two steps allow a carboxylate group to be transferred from oxaloacetate to propionyl-CoA to yield pyruvate and methylmalonyl-CoA.  The catalytic domain of transcarboxylase 5S has a canonical TIM-barrel fold with a large C-terminal extension that forms a funnel leading to the active site.  Transcarboxylase 5S forms a homodimer and there are six dimers per complex.  In addition to the catalytic domain, transcarboxylase 5S has several other domains including a carbamoyl-phosphate synthase domain, a biotin carboxylase domain, a carboxyltransferase domain, and an ATP-grasp domain.  Pyruvate carboxylase, like TC, is a biotin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate.  In mammals, PC has critical roles in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, glyceroneogenesis, and insulin secretion.  Inherited PC deficiencies are linked to serious diseases in humans such as lactic acidemia, hypoglycemia, psychomotor retardation, and death.

Some members, like MJ0490 from Methanococcus jannaschii, exhibit both MDH and LDH activities. Tetrameric MDHs, including those from phototrophic bacteria, are more similar to LDHs than to other MDHs. LDH catalyzes the last step of glycolysis in which pyruvate is converted to L-lactate. MDH is one of the key enzymes in the citric acid cycle, facilitating both the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate and replenishing levels of oxalacetate by reductive carboxylation of pyruvate. The LDH-like MDHs are part of the NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily, which includes a wide variety of protein families including the NAD(P)-binding domains of alcohol dehydrogenases, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases, formate/glycerate dehydrogenases, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, aminoacid dehydrogenases, repressor rex, and NAD-binding potassium channel domains, among others.

This model describes the metallopeptidase M23 family, which includes beta-lytic metallopeptidase and lysostaphin. Members of this family are zinc endopeptidases that lyse bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans; they cleave either the N-acylmuramoyl-Ala bond between the cell wall peptidoglycan and the cross-linking peptide (e.g. beta-lytic endopeptidase) or a bond within the cross-linking peptide (e.g. stapholysin, and lysostaphin). Beta-lytic metallopeptidase, formerly known as beta-lytic protease, has a preference for cleavage of Gly-X bonds and favors hydrophobic or apolar residues on either side. It inhibits growth of sensitive organisms and may potentially serve as an antimicrobial agent. Lysostaphin, produced by Staphylococcus genus, cleaves pentaglycine cross-bridges of cell wall peptidoglycan, acting as autolysins to maintain cell wall metabolism or as toxins and weapons against competing strains. Staphylolysin (also known as LasA) is implicated in a range of processes related to Pseudomonas virulence, including stimulating shedding of the ectodomain of cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycan syndecan-1, and elastin degradation in connective tissue. Its active site is less constricted and contains a five-coordinate zinc ion with trigonal bipyramidal geometry and two metal-bound water molecules, possibly contributing to its activity against a wider range of substrates than those used by related lytic enzymes, consistent with its multiple roles in Pseudomonas virulence. The family includes members that do not appear to have the conserved zinc-binding site and might be lipoproteins lacking proteolytic activity.

The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways.

IMPDH is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the first step unique to GTP synthesis, playing a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).

Met-tRNA-FMT transfers a formyl group from N-10 formyltetrahydrofolate to the amino terminal end of a methionyl-aminoacyl-tRNA acyl moiety, yielding formyl-Met-tRNA. Formyl-Met-tRNA plays essential role in protein translation initiation by forming complex with IF2. The formyl group plays a dual role in the initiator identity of N-formylmethionyl-tRNA by promoting its recognition by IF2 and by impairing its binding to EFTU-GTP.  The N-terminal domain contains a Rossmann fold and it is the catalytic domain of the enzyme.		CDD:187715			44.076	211.0	108.0	4.0	3.0	211.0	2.0	204.0	1.75e-79	238.0

Amino acid dehydrogenase (DH) is a widely distributed family of enzymes that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of an amino acid to its keto acid and ammonia with concomitant reduction of NADP+. Glutamate DH is a multidomain enzyme that catalyzes the reaction from glutamate to 2-oxyoglutarate and ammonia in the presence of NAD or NADP. It is present in all organisms. Enzymes involved in ammonia asimilation are typically NADP+-dependent, while those involved in glutamate catabolism are generally NAD+-dependent. Amino acid DH-like NAD(P)-binding domains are members of the Rossmann fold superfamily and include glutamate, leucine, and phenylalanine DHs, methylene tetrahydrofolate DH, methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin DH, methylene-tetrahydropholate DH/cyclohydrolase, Shikimate DH-like proteins, malate oxidoreductases, and glutamyl tRNA reductase. Amino acid DHs catalyze the deamination of amino acids to keto acids with NAD(P)+ as a cofactor. The NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily includes a wide variety of protein families including NAD(P)- binding domains of alcohol DHs, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate DH, lactate/malate DHs, formate/glycerate DHs, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate DH, amino acid DHs, repressor rex, NAD-binding potassium channel  domain, CoA-binding, and ornithine cyclodeaminase-like domains. These domains have an alpha -beta-alpha configuration. NAD binding involves numerous hydrogen and van der Waals contacts.

This CD includes the second of two ACT domains C-terminal to the catalytic domain of aspartokinase (AK; 4-L-aspartate-4-phosphotransferase).

AK catalyzes the conversion of aspartate and ATP to aspartylphosphate and ADP. AK is the first enzyme in the pathway of the biosynthesis of the aspartate family of amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, and isoleucine) and the bacterial cell wall component, meso-diaminopimelate. One mechanism for the regulation of this pathway is by the production of several isoenzymes of AK with different repressors and allosteric inhibitors. Pairs of ACT domains are proposed to specifically bind amino acids leading to allosteric regulation of the enzyme. In Escherichia coli (EC), three different AK isoenzymes are regulated specifically by lysine, methionine, and threonine. AK-HSDHI (ThrA) and AK-HSDHII (MetL) are bifunctional enzymes that consist of an N-terminal AK and a C-terminal homoserine dehydrogenase (HSDH). ThrA and MetL are involved in threonine and methionine biosynthesis, respectively. The third isoenzyme, AKIII (LysC), is monofunctional and is involved in lysine synthesis. The three Bacillus subtilis (BS) isoenzymes, AKI (DapG), AKII (LysC), and AKIII (YclM), are feedback inhibited by meso-diaminopimelate, lysine, and lysine plus threonine, respectively. The E. coli lysine-sensitive AK is described as a homodimer, whereas, the B. subtilis lysine-sensitive AK is described as is a heterodimeric complex of alpha- and beta- subunits that are formed from two in-frame overlapping genes. A single AK enzyme type has been described in Pseudomonas, Amycolatopsis, and Corynebacterium, and apparently, unique to cyanobacteria, are AKs with two tandem pairs of ACT domains, C-terminal to the catalytic domain. The fungal aspartate pathway is regulated at the AK step, with L-Thr being an allosteric inhibitor of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AK (Hom3). At least two distinct AK isoenzymes can occur in higher plants, a monofunctional lysine-sensitive isoenzyme, which is involved in the overall regulation of the pathway and can be synergistically inhibited by S-adenosylmethionine. The other isoenzyme is a bifunctional, threonine-sensitive AK-HSDH protein.

AK and HSDH are the first and third enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of the aspartate family of amino acids. AK catalyzes the phosphorylation of Asp to P-aspartyl phosphate. HSDH catalyzes the NADPH-dependent conversion of Asp 3-semialdehyde to homoserine. ThrA and MetL are involved in threonine and methionine biosynthesis, respectively. In E. coli, ThrA is subject to allosteric regulation by the end product L-threonine and the native enzyme is reported to be tetrameric. As with bacteria, plant AK and HSDH are feedback inhibited by pathway end products. Maize AK-HSDH is a Thr-sensitive 180-kD enzyme. Arabidopsis AK-HSDH is an alanine-activated, threonine-sensitive enzyme whose ACT domains, located C-terminal to the AK catalytic domain, were shown to be involved in allosteric activation.

The lytic vacuole is thought to be equivalent to the mammalian lysosome and the yeast vacuole. Pea BP-80 is a type 1 transmembrane protein, involved in the targeting of proteins to the lytic vacuole; it has been suggested that this protein also mediates targeting to the storage vacuole. PV72 and AtVSR1 may mediate transport of seed storage proteins to protein storage vacuoles. The significance of the PA domain to VSRs has not been ascertained.

Bacteria and archaea import molybdenum and tungsten from the environment in the form of the oxyanions molybdate (MoO(4) (2-)) and tungstate (WO(4) (2-)). After binding molybdate with high affinity, they interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase.  This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.

The G-domain is composed of about 200 amino acid residues, arranged into a predominantly parallel six-stranded beta-sheet core surrounded by seven alpha helices. Non-catalytic domains II and III are beta-barrels of seven and six, respectively, antiparallel beta-strands that share an extended interface. Both non-catalytic domains are composed of about 100 amino acid residues. EF-Tu proteins exist in two principal conformations: a compact one, EF-Tu*GTP, with tight interfaces between all three domains and a high affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA; and an open one, EF-Tu*GDP, with essentially no G-domain-domain II interactions and a low affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA.

The M14 family are zinc-binding carboxypeptidases (CPs) which hydrolyze single, C-terminal amino acids from polypeptide chains, and have a recognition site for the free C-terminal carboxyl group, which is a key determinant of specificity. Two major subfamilies of the M14 family, defined based on sequence and structural homology, are the A/B and N/E subfamilies. Enzymes belonging to the A/B subfamily are normally synthesized as inactive precursors containing preceding signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal pro-region linked to the enzyme; these proenzymes are called procarboxypeptidases. The A/B enzymes can be further divided based on their substrate specificity; Carboxypeptidase A-like (CPA-like) enzymes favor hydrophobic residues while carboxypeptidase B-like (CPB-like) enzymes only cleave the basic residues lysine or arginine. The A forms have slightly different specificities, with Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) preferring aliphatic and small aromatic residues, and CPA2 preferring the bulky aromatic side chains. Enzymes belonging to the N/E subfamily enzymes are not produced as inactive precursors and instead rely on their substrate specificity and subcellular compartmentalization to prevent inappropriate cleavages. They contain an extra C-terminal transthyretin-like domain, thought to be involved in folding or formation of oligomers.  MCPs can also be classified based on their involvement in specific physiological processes; the pancreatic MCPs participate only in alimentary digestion and include carboxypeptidase A and B (A/B subfamily), while others, namely regulatory MCPs or the N/E subfamily, are involved in more selective reactions, mainly in non-digestive tissues and fluids, acting on blood coagulation/fibrinolysis, inflammation and local anaphylaxis, pro-hormone and neuropeptide processing, cellular response and others.   Another MCP subfamily, is that of succinylglutamate desuccinylase /aspartoacylase, which hydrolyzes N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), and deficiency in which is the established cause of Canavan disease. Another subfamily (referred to as subfamily C) includes an exceptional type of activity in the MCP family, that of dipeptidyl-peptidase activity of gamma-glutamyl-(L)-meso-diaminopimelate peptidase I which is involved in bacterial cell wall metabolism.

All GH31 enzymes cleave a terminal carbohydrate moiety from a substrate that varies considerably in size, depending on the enzyme, and may be either a starch or a glycoprotein. In most cases, the pyranose moiety recognized in subsite-1 of the substrate binding site is an alpha-D-glucose, though some GH31 family members show a preference for alpha-D-xylose. Several GH31 enzymes can accommodate both glucose and xylose and different levels of discrimination between the two have been observed. Most characterized GH31 enzymes are alpha-glucosidases. In mammals, GH31 members with alpha-glucosidase activity are implicated in at least three distinct biological processes. The lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) is essential for glycogen degradation and a deficiency or malfunction of this enzyme causes glycogen storage disease II, also known as Pompe disease. In the endoplasmic reticulum, alpha-glucosidase II catalyzes the second step in the N-linked oligosaccharide processing pathway that constitutes part of the quality control system for glycoprotein folding and maturation. The intestinal enzymes sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) play key roles in the final stage of carbohydrate digestion, making alpha-glucosidase inhibitors useful in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. GH31 alpha-glycosidases are retaining enzymes that cleave their substrates via an acid/base-catalyzed, double-displacement mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. Two aspartic acid residues of the catalytic domain have been identified as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, respectively.

ArnA, is an enzyme involved in the modification of outer membrane protein lipid A of gram-negative bacteria. It is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the NAD-dependent decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid and N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent formylation of UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose; its NAD-dependent decaboxylating activity is in the C-terminal 360 residues. This subgroup belongs to the extended SDR family, however the NAD binding motif is not a perfect match and the upstream Asn of the canonical active site tetrad is not conserved. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif.		CDD:187567			42.566	343.0	163.0	9.0	317.0	652.0	1.0	316.0	2.65e-136	400.0

STKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine residues on protein substrates. This subfamily includes many bacterial eukaryotic-type STKs including Staphylococcus aureus PknB (also called PrkC or Stk1), Bacillus subtilis PrkC, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Pkn proteins (PknB, PknD, PknE, PknF, PknL, and PknH), among others. S. aureus PknB is the only eukaryotic-type STK present in this species, although many microorganisms encode for several such proteins. It is important for the survival and pathogenesis of S. aureus as it is involved in the regulation of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, autolysis, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. M. tuberculosis PknB is essential for growth and it acts on diverse substrates including proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, cell division, transcription, stress responses, and metabolic regulation. B. subtilis PrkC is located at the inner membrane of endospores and functions to trigger spore germination. Bacterial STKs in this subfamily show varied domain architectures. The well-characterized members such as S. aureus and M. tuberculosis PknB, and B. subtilis PrkC, contain an N-terminal cytosolic  kinase domain, a transmembrane (TM) segment, and mutliple C-terminal extracellular PASTA domains. The PknB subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other protein STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.

Papain-like enzymes are mostly endopeptidases with some exceptions like cathepsins B, C, H and X, which are exopeptidases. Papain-like CPs have different functions in various organisms. Plant CPs are used to mobilize storage proteins in seeds while mammalian CPs are primarily lysosomal enzymes responsible for protein degradation in the lysosome. Papain-like CPs are synthesized as inactive proenzymes with N-terminal propeptide regions, which are removed upon activation. Bleomycin hydrolase (BH) is a CP that detoxifies bleomycin by hydrolysis of an amide group. It acts as a carboxypeptidase on its C-terminus to convert itself into an aminopeptidase and peptide ligase. BH is found in all tissues in mammals as well as in many other eukaryotes. It forms a hexameric ring barrel structure with the active sites imbedded in the central channel. Some members of the C1 family are proteins classified as non-peptidase homologs which lack peptidase activity or have missing active site residues.

This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding domain of nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide transport systems, which function in the import of nickel and peptides, and other closely related proteins. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is a periplasmic component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system OppABCDEF consisting of five subunits: two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Similar to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems, nickel transporter is comprised of five subunits NikABCDE: the two pore-forming integral inner membrane proteins NikB and NikC; the two inner membrane-associated proteins with ATPase activity NikD and NikE; and the periplasmic nickel binding NikA, which is the initial nickel receptor that controls the chemotactic response away from nickel.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand binding domains of ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

The iron protein is a homodimer, with an Fe4S4 cluster bound between the subunits and two ATP-binding domains. It supplies energy by ATP hydrolysis, and transfers electrons from reduced ferredoxin or flavodoxin to component 1 for the reduction of molecular nitrogen to ammonia.

The Bug (Bordetella uptake gene) protein family is a large family of periplasmic solute-binding (PBP) proteins present in a number of bacterial species, but mainly in proteobacteria. In eubacteria, at least three families of periplasmic binding-protein dependent transporters are known: the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporters, and the tripartite tricarboxylate transporters (TTT). Bug proteins are the PBP components of the TTT. Their expansive expansion in proteobacteria indicates a large functional diversity. The best studied examples are Bordetella pertussis BugD, which is an aspartic acid transporter, and BugE, which is glutamate transporter.

Alpha-lytic protease (EC 3.4.21.12; also called alpha-lytic endopeptidase), originally isolated from the myxobacterium Lysobacter enzymogenes, belongs to the MEROPS peptidase family S1, subfamily S1E (streptogrisin A subfamily). It is synthesized as a pro-enzyme, thus having two domains; the N-terminal pro-domain acts as a foldase, required transiently for the correct folding of the protease domain, and also acts as a potent inhibitor of the mature enzyme, while the C-terminal domain catalyzes the cleavage of peptide bonds. Members of the alpha-lytic protease subfamily include Nocardiopsis alba protease (NAPase), a secreted chymotrypsin from the alkaliphile Cellulomonas bogoriensis, streptogrisins (SPG-A, SPG-B, SPG-C, and SPG-D), and Thermobifida fusca protease A (TFPA). These serine proteases have characteristic kinetic stability, exhibited by their extremely slow unfolding kinetics. The active site, characteristic of serine proteases, contains the catalytic triad consisting of serine acting as a nucleophile, aspartate as an electrophile, and histidine as a base, all required for activity.

EF-Tu proteins exist in two principal conformations: a compact one, EF-Tu*GTP, with tight interfaces between all three domains and a high affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA; and an open one, EF-Tu*GDP, with essentially no G-domain-domain II interactions and a low affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA. EF-Tu has approximately a 100-fold higher affinity for GDP than for GTP.		CDD:293898			77.273	88.0	19.0	1.0	216.0	303.0	1.0	87.0	1.0700000000000001e-49	160.0

tr|D5EG33|D5EG33_AMICL	cd02947		TRX family; composed of two groups: Group I, which includes proteins that exclusively encode a TRX domain; and Group II, which are composed of fusion proteins of TRX and additional domains. Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif. Group II proteins, in addition to either a redox active TRX or a TRX-like domain, also contain additional domains, which may or may not possess homology to known proteins.

The functional unit of typical 2-cys PRX is a homodimer. A unique intermolecular redox-active disulfide center is utilized for its activity. Upon reaction with peroxides, its peroxidatic cysteine is oxidized into a sulfenic acid intermediate which is resolved by bonding with the resolving cysteine from the other subunit of the homodimer. This intermolecular disulfide bond is then reduced by thioredoxin, tryparedoxin or AhpF. Typical 2-cys PRXs, like 1-cys PRXs, form decamers which are stabilized by reduction of the active site cysteine. Typical 2-cys PRX interacts through beta strands at one edge of the monomer (B-type interface) to form the functional homodimer, and uses an A-type interface (similar to the dimeric interface in atypical 2-cys PRX and PRX5) at the opposite end of the monomer to form the stable decameric (pentamer of dimers) structure.

tr|D7F197|D7F197_9CYAN	cd08955		beta-ketoacyl reductase (KR) domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS), subgroup 2, complex (x). Ketoreductase, a module of the multidomain polyketide synthase, has 2 subdomains, each corresponding  to a short-chain dehydrogenases/reductase (SDR) family monomer. The C-terminal subdomain catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the beta-carbonyl of a polyketide to a hydroxyl group, a step in the biosynthesis of polyketides, such as erythromycin.  The N-terminal subdomain, an interdomain linker, is a truncated Rossmann fold which acts to stabilizes the catalytic subdomain. Unlike typical SDRs, the isolated domain does not oligomerizes but is composed of 2 subdomains, each resembling an SDR monomer.  In some instances,  as in porcine FAS, an enoyl reductase (a Rossman fold NAD binding domain of the MDR family) module is inserted between the sub-domains.  The active site resembles that of typical SDRs, except that the usual positions of the catalytic asparagine and tyrosine are swapped, so that the canonical YXXXK motif changes to YXXXN. Modular polyketide synthases are multifunctional structures in which the makeup recapitulates that found in (and may have evolved from) fatty acid synthase.   In some instances, such as porcine FAS , an enoyl reductase module is inserted between the sub-domains. Fatty acid synthesis occurs via the stepwise elongation of a chain (which is attached to acyl carrier protein, ACP) with 2-carbon units. Eukaryotic systems consists of large, multifunctional synthases (type I) while bacterial, type II systems, use single function proteins. Fungal fatty acid synthesis uses dodecamer of 6 alpha and 6 beta subunits. In mammalian type FAS cycles,  ketoacyl synthase forms acetoacetyl-ACP which is reduced by the NADP-dependent beta-ketoacyl reductase (KR), forming beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP, which is in turn dehydrated by dehydratase to a beta-enoyl intermediate, which is reduced by NADP-dependent beta-enoyl reductase (ER). Polyketide syntheses also proceeds via the addition of 2-carbon units as in fatty acid synthesis.  The complex SDR NADP binding motif, GGXGXXG, is often present, but is not strictly conserved in each instance of the module. This subfamily includes the KR domain of the Lyngbya majuscule Jam J, -K, and #L  which are encoded on the jam gene cluster and are involved in the synthesis of the Jamaicamides (neurotoxins); Lyngbya majuscule Jam P belongs to a different KR_FAS_SDR_x subfamily. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.

The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. For many of these enzymes the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits.

This model includes Xenorhabdus nematophila alpha-xenorhabdolysin (XaxA) and Yersinia enterocolitica YaxA, both parts of two-component alpha-helical pore-forming toxins (alpha-PFTs). The xaxAB genes encoding the XaxAB toxin have also been also identified in various plant and human pathogens.  XaxAB triggers necrosis and apoptosis in both insect hemocytes and mammalian cells. Structure studies show that component A binds to component B's back, forming a subunit; twelve to fifteen of these subunits then conjoin as the pore-forming toxin. Component A stabilizes each subunit on the membrane and activates component B, which then punctures the membrane by swinging out its lower end. Similarly, Yersinia enterocolitica YaxA, encoded by the yaxAB gene, forms a pore predominantly composed of decamers of YaxA-YaxB heterodimers. Although both subunits bear membrane-active moieties, only YaxA is capable of binding to membranes by itself and YaxB is subsequently recruited to membrane-associated YaxA and induced to present its lytic transmembrane helices; pore formation then progresses by further oligomerization of YaxA-YaxB dimers. YaxAB has been found to be strongly upregulated by the Yersinia master regulator RovA,  a transcriptional activator of Yersinia outer membrane protein invasion which is involved in bacterial attachment and invasion across the intestinal epithelium.

A similar system also exists in some bacteria. The homologous pair of proteins (FixA/FixB) are essential for nitrogen fixation.

tr|D8FHP6|D8FHP6_9FIRM	cd08504		The substrate-binding component of an ABC-type oligopetide import system contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type oligopeptide transport system comprised of 5 subunits. The transport system OppABCDEF contains two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand-binding domains from ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP.

The fascin-like family includes actin-bundling/crosslinking proteins facsin1-4, singed, hisactophilin, and FSHD region gene 1 protein (FRG1). Fascin, also called fascin-1, is an actin-binding protein that contains 2 major actin binding sites. It is involved in the organization of actin filament bundles and the formation of microspikes, membrane ruffles, and stress fibers. It plays an important role for the formation of a diverse set of cell protrusions, such as filopodia, and for cell motility and migration. It mediates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and axon growth cone collapse in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). Fascin-2, also called retinal fascin, is a photoreceptor-specific paralog of the actin-bundling protein fascin. It may play a pivotal role in photoreceptor cell-specific events, such as disk morphogenesis. Fascin-3, also called testis fascin, is a novel paralog of the actin-bundling protein fascin expressed specifically in the elongate spermatid head. Protein singed acts as an actin-bundling protein that may have a role in the asymmetric organization and/or movement of cytoplasmic components. It has a role in somatic cells during the formation of adult bristles and hairs, and in the female germline during oogenesis. Hisactophilin is a histidine-rich actin-binding protein from Dictyostelium discoideum. It exists in two isoforms, hisactophilin-1 (HatA, also called HS I) and hisactophilin-2 (HatB, also called HS II), which are both myristoylated and distributed between plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Hisactophilin may act as an intracellular pH sensor that links chemotactic signals to responses in the microfilament system of the cells by nucleating actin polymerization or stabilizing the filaments. Protein FRG1 binds to mRNA in a sequence-independent manner. It may play a role in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing or in the assembly of rRNA into ribosomal subunits. It may be involved in mRNA transport, as well as in epigenetic regulation of muscle differentiation through regulation of activity of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase KMT5B. This family also contains many homologs from bacteria, such as Zobellia galactanivorans beta-porphyranase A (PorA). PorA (EC 3.2.1.178) cleaves the sulfated polysaccharide porphyran at the (1->4) linkages between beta-D-galactopyranose and alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate, forming mostly the disaccharide alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate-(1->3)-beta-D-galactose.

It is involved in the organization of actin filament bundles and the formation of microspikes, membrane ruffles, and stress fibers. It plays an important role for the formation of a diverse set of cell protrusions, such as filopodia, and for cell motility and migration. It mediates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and axon growth cone collapse in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). Fascin-2, also called retinal fascin, is a photoreceptor-specific paralog of the actin-bundling protein fascin. It may play a pivotal role in photoreceptor cell-specific events, such as disk morphogenesis. Fascin-3, also called testis fascin, is a novel paralog of the actin-bundling protein fascin expressed specifically in the elongate spermatid head. Protein singed acts as an actin-bundling protein that may have a role in the asymmetric organization and/or movement of cytoplasmic components. It has a role in somatic cells during the formation of adult bristles and hairs, and in the female germline during oogenesis. Hisactophilin is a histidine-rich actin-binding protein from Dictyostelium discoideum. It exists in two isoforms, hisactophilin-1 (HatA, also called HS I) and hisactophilin-2 (HatB, also called HS II), which are both myristoylated and distributed between plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Hisactophilin may act as an intracellular pH sensor that links chemotactic signals to responses in the microfilament system of the cells by nucleating actin polymerization or stabilizing the filaments. Protein FRG1 binds to mRNA in a sequence-independent manner. It may play a role in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing or in the assembly of rRNA into ribosomal subunits. It may be involved in mRNA transport, as well as in epigenetic regulation of muscle differentiation through regulation of activity of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase KMT5B. This family also contains many homologs from bacteria, such as Zobellia galactanivorans beta-porphyranase A (PorA). PorA (EC 3.2.1.178) cleaves the sulfated polysaccharide porphyran at the (1->4) linkages between beta-D-galactopyranose and alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate, forming mostly the disaccharide alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate-(1->3)-beta-D-galactose. It is inactive on the non-sulfated agarose portion of the porphyran backbone and displays a strict requirement for C6-sulfate in the -2 and +1-binding subsites. Members of this family contain a fascin-like domain with a beta-trefoil fold, which is characterized by 12 beta strands folded into three similar trefoil subdomains (alpha, beta, and gamma) associated to give an overall structure with pseudo-3-fold symmetry. The fascin subfamily contains four copies of the fascin-like domain.		CDD:467441			32.911	79.0	46.0	4.0	1192.0	1269.0	10.0	82.0	4.26e-14	69.2

Included in this family is Streptomyces sp. SirexAA-E (SacteLam55A), a secreted protein encoded by SACTE_4363. Structural studies reveal an extended substrate-binding cleft with six or more subsites for sugar binding formed at the interface of two right handed beta-helical domains. They also give insight into residues that enforce an exolytic reaction, interactions that potentially support a processive hydrolysis of the bound oligosaccharide, and the ability of the enzyme to accommodate substrates with beta-1,6 branching. Mutation studies support a critical glutamate as a catalytic acid and a proton relay network that activates water to serve as the catalytic base. Also included in this family are Saccharophagus degradans Gly5M, a novel protein identified as a beta-1,3-endoglucanase (EC 3.2.1.39) and bacterial beta-1,6-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.75) in GH5, and Corallococcus sp. strain EGB LamC, identified as a novel member of the GH16 family.

tr|E5ATN3|E5ATN3_MYCRK	cd04623		Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains present in bacteria and eukaryotes. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).

This model includes Xenorhabdus nematophila alpha-xenorhabdolysin (XaxA) and Yersinia enterocolitica YaxA, both parts of two-component alpha-helical pore-forming toxins (alpha-PFTs). The xaxAB genes encoding the XaxAB toxin have also been also identified in various plant and human pathogens.  XaxAB triggers necrosis and apoptosis in both insect hemocytes and mammalian cells. Structure studies show that component A binds to component B's back, forming a subunit; twelve to fifteen of these subunits then conjoin as the pore-forming toxin. Component A stabilizes each subunit on the membrane and activates component B, which then punctures the membrane by swinging out its lower end. Similarly, Yersinia enterocolitica YaxA, encoded by the yaxAB gene, forms a pore predominantly composed of decamers of YaxA-YaxB heterodimers. Although both subunits bear membrane-active moieties, only YaxA is capable of binding to membranes by itself and YaxB is subsequently recruited to membrane-associated YaxA and induced to present its lytic transmembrane helices; pore formation then progresses by further oligomerization of YaxA-YaxB dimers.

The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. For many of these enzymes the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits.

The G-domain is composed of about 200 amino acid residues, arranged into a predominantly parallel six-stranded beta-sheet core surrounded by seven alpha helices. Non-catalytic domains II and III are beta-barrels of seven and six, respectively, antiparallel beta-strands that share an extended interface. Both non-catalytic domains are composed of about 100 amino acid residues. EF-Tu proteins exist in two principal conformations: a compact one, EF-Tu*GTP, with tight interfaces between all three domains and a high affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA; and an open one, EF-Tu*GDP, with essentially no G-domain-domain II interactions and a low affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA. EF-Tu has approximately a 100-fold higher affinity for GDP than for GTP.		CDD:293898			73.864	88.0	22.0	1.0	216.0	303.0	1.0	87.0	3.06e-49	159.0

Domain III is involved in binding to both charged tRNA and to elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts). EF-Ts is the guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor for EF-Tu. EF-Tu and EF-G participate in the elongation phase during protein biosynthesis on the ribosome. Their functional cycles depend on GTP binding and its hydrolysis. The EF-Tu complexed with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA delivers tRNA to the ribosome, whereas EF-G stimulates translocation, a process in which tRNA and mRNA movements occur in the ribosome. Crystallographic studies revealed structural similarities (""molecular mimicry"") between tertiary structures of EF-G and the EF-Tu-aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complex.

The structure of EF-G closely resembles that of the complex between EF-Tu and tRNA. This is an example of molecular mimicry; a protein domain evolved so that it mimics the shape of a tRNA molecule. EF-G in the GTP form binds to the ribosome, primarily through the interaction of its EF-Tu-like domain with the 50S subunit. The binding of EF-G to the ribosome in this manner stimulates the GTPase activity of EF-G. On GTP hydrolysis, EF-G undergoes a conformational change that forces its arm deeper into the A site on the 30S subunit. To accommodate this domain, the peptidyl-tRNA in the A site moves to the P site, carrying the mRNA and the deacylated tRNA with it. The ribosome may be prepared for these rearrangements by the initial binding of EF-G as well. The dissociation of EF-G leaves the ribosome ready to accept the next aminoacyl-tRNA into the A site.

Domains in this subgroup are uncharacterized members of the Peptidase family C25 N-terminal domain family. Peptidases family C25 are a unique class of cysteine proteases, exemplified by gingipain, which is produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. gingivalis is one of the primary gram-negative pathogens that causes periodontitis, a disease that is also associated with other diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Gingipains are a group of extracellular Arg- and Lys-specific proteinases called Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp); RgpA and RgpB are homologous Arg-specific gingipains encoded by two closely related genes, rgpA and rgpB, while Lys-specific gingipain is encoded by the single kgp gene. Mutant studies have shown that, among the large quantities of proteolytic enzymes produced by P. gingivalis, these three proteases are major virulence factors of this bacterium. All three genes encode an N-terminal pre-pro fragment, followed by the protease domain; however, rgpA and kgp also encode additional C-terminal HA (hemaglutinin/adhesion) subunits which consist of several sequence-related adhesion domains. Although unique, their cysteine protease active site residues (His and Cys) forming the catalytic dyad are well-conserved, cleaving the C-terminal peptide bond with Arg or Lys residues. Gingipains are evolutionarily related to other highly specific proteases including caspases, clostripain, legumains, and separase. Gingipains function by dysregulating host defense and inflammatory responses, and degrading host proteins, e.g. tissue, cells, matrix, plasma and immunological proteins. They are proposed to enhance gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) production through activation of the kallikrein/kinin pathways, thus increasing vascular permeability and causing gingival inflammation, a distinctive feature of periodontitis. RgpA and RgpB are also able to cleave and activate coagulation factors IX and X in order to activate prothrombin to produce thrombin, which in turn increases production of GCF. The gingipains also play a pivotal role in the survival of P. gingivalis in the host by attacking the host defense system through cleavage of several immunological molecules, while at the same time evading the host-immune response by dysregulating the cytokine network.

MTSase is responsible for converting the alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage to an alpha,alpha-1,1-glucosidic linkage at the reducing end of the maltooligosaccharide through an intramolecular transglucosylation reaction, while MTHase hydrolyzes the penultimate alpha-1,4 linkage of the reducing end, resulting in the release of trehalose. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key.

The active enzyme is a heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta chains, where the alpha and beta chains are the result of autocatalytic cleavage. OATs found in the clavulanic acid biosynthesis gene cluster catalyze the fifth step only, and may utilize acetyl acceptors other than glutamate.

Examples of heterodimeric members with alpha and beta subunits include arsenite oxidase, and tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase (FDH-T) while   heterotrimeric members containing alpha, beta, and gamma subunits include formate dehydrogenase-N (FDH-N), and nitrate reductase (NarGHI).  The beta subunit contains four Fe4/S4 and/or Fe3/S4 clusters which transfer the electrons from the alpha subunit to a hydrophobic integral membrane protein, presumably a cytochrome containing two b-type heme groups.

Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP family), pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain, of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (IOR) alpha subunit (IOR-alpha), and related proteins, subfamily. The PYR domain is found in many key metabolic enzymes which use TPP (also known as thiamine diphosphate) as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. For many of these enzymes the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits. However, for the homodimeric enzyme Desulfovibrio africanus pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), each active site lies at the interface of the PYR and PP domains from the same subunit. This subfamily includes proteins characterized as pyruvate NADP+ oxidoreductase (PNO). PFOR and PNO catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA, a crucial step in many metabolic pathways. The facultative anaerobic mitochondrion of the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis oxidizes pyruvate with PNO. IOR catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of arylpyruvates, such as indolepyruvate or phenylpyruvate.		CDD:132917			38.65	163.0	95.0	3.0	21.0	181.0	1.0	160.0	1.29e-53	173.0
tr|F4BTF5|F4BTF5_METSG	cd07304		Chorismase synthase, the enzyme catalyzing the final step of the shikimate pathway. Chorismate synthase (CS; 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate phospholyase; 1-carboxyvinyl-3-phosphoshikimate phosphate-lyase; E.C. 4.2.3.5) catalyzes the seventh and final step in the shikimate pathway: the conversion of 5- enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) to chorismate, a precursor for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds. This process has an absolute requirement for reduced FMN as a co-factor which is thought to facilitate cleavage of C-O bonds by transiently donating an electron to the substrate, having no overall change its redox state. Depending on the capacity of these enzymes to regenerate the reduced form of FMN, chorismate synthases are divided into two classes: Enzymes, mostly from plants and eubacteria, that sequester CS from the cellular environment, are monofunctiona,l while those that can generate reduced FMN at the expense of NADPH, such as found in fungi and the ciliated protozoan Euglena gracilis, are bifunctional, having an additional NADPH:FMN oxidoreductase activity. Recently, bifunctionality of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme (MtCS) was determined by measurements of both chorismate synthase and NADH:FMN oxidoreductase activities. Since shikimate pathway enzymes are present in bacteria, fungi and apicomplexan parasites (such as Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum, and Cryptosporidium parvum) but absent in mammals, they are potentially attractive targets for the development of new therapy against infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB).

Papain is an endopeptidase with specific substrate preferences, primarily for bulky hydrophobic or aromatic residues at the S2 subsite, a hydrophobic pocket in papain that accommodates the P2 sidechain of the substrate (the second residue away from the scissile bond). Most members of the papain subfamily are endopeptidases. Some exceptions to this rule can be explained by specific details of the catalytic domains like the occluding loop in cathepsin B which confers an additional carboxydipeptidyl activity and the mini-chain of cathepsin H resulting in an N-terminal exopeptidase activity. Papain-like CPs have different functions in various organisms. Plant CPs are used to mobilize storage proteins in seeds. Parasitic CPs act extracellularly to help invade tissues and cells, to hatch or to evade the host immune system. Mammalian CPs are primarily lysosomal enzymes with the exception of cathepsin W, which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. They are responsible for protein degradation in the lysosome. Papain-like CPs are synthesized as inactive proenzymes with N-terminal propeptide regions, which are removed upon activation. In addition to its inhibitory role, the propeptide is required for proper folding of the newly synthesized enzyme and its stabilization in denaturing pH conditions. Residues within the propeptide region also play a role in the transport of the proenzyme to lysosomes or acidified vesicles. Also included in this subfamily are proteins classified as non-peptidase homologs, which lack peptidase activity or have missing active site residues.

Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases (PGDHs) catalyze the initial step in the biosynthesis of L-serine from D-3-phosphoglycerate. PGDHs come in 3 distinct structural forms, with this first group being related to 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases, sharing structural similarity to formate and glycerate dehydrogenases. PGDH in E. coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis form tetramers, with subunits containing a Rossmann-fold NAD binding domain. Formate/glycerate and related dehydrogenases of the D-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase superfamily include groups such as formate dehydrogenase, glycerate dehydrogenase, L-alanine dehydrogenase, and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. Despite often low sequence identity, these proteins typically have a characteristic arrangement of 2 similar subdomains of the alpha/beta Rossmann fold NAD+ binding form. The NAD+ binding domain is inserted within the linear sequence of the mostly N-terminal catalytic domain, which has a similar domain structure to the internal NAD binding domain. Structurally, these domains are connected by extended alpha helices and create a cleft in which NAD is bound, primarily to the C-terminal portion of the 2nd (internal) domain. Some related proteins have similar structural subdomain but with a tandem arrangement of the catalytic and NAD-binding subdomains in the linear sequence.

This CD represents the substrate-binding domain of an uncharacterized ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide-like transporter. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA and the dipeptide-binding protein DppA show significant sequence similarity to NikA, the initial nickel receptor. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis. Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand-binding domains from ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators,  and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.

Malic enzyme (ME), a member of the amino acid dehydrogenase (DH)-like domain family, catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of L-malate to pyruvate in the presence of cations (typically  Mg++ or Mn++) with the concomitant reduction of cofactor NAD+ or NADP+.  ME has been found in all organisms, and plays important roles in diverse metabolic pathways such as photosynthesis and lipogenesis. This enzyme generally forms homotetramers. The conversion of malate to pyruvate by ME typically involves oxidation of malate to produce oxaloacetate, followed by decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to produce pyruvate and CO2.  This subfamily consists primarily of archaeal and bacterial ME.  Amino acid DH-like NAD(P)-binding domains are members of the Rossmann fold superfamily and include glutamate, leucine, and phenylalanine DHs, methylene tetrahydrofolate DH, methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin DH, methylene-tetrahydropholate DH/cyclohydrolase, Shikimate DH-like proteins, malate oxidoreductases, and glutamyl tRNA reductase. Amino acid DHs catalyze the deamination of amino acids to keto acids with NAD(P)+ as a cofactor. The NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily includes a wide variety of protein families including NAD(P)- binding domains of alcohol DHs, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate DH, lactate/malate DHs, formate/glycerate DHs, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate DH, amino acid DHs, repressor rex, NAD-binding potassium channel  domain, CoA-binding, and ornithine cyclodeaminase-like domains.

Papain-like enzymes are mostly endopeptidases with some exceptions like cathepsins B, C, H and X, which are exopeptidases. Papain-like CPs have different functions in various organisms. Plant CPs are used to mobilize storage proteins in seeds while mammalian CPs are primarily lysosomal enzymes responsible for protein degradation in the lysosome. Papain-like CPs are synthesized as inactive proenzymes with N-terminal propeptide regions, which are removed upon activation. Bleomycin hydrolase (BH) is a CP that detoxifies bleomycin by hydrolysis of an amide group. It acts as a carboxypeptidase on its C-terminus to convert itself into an aminopeptidase and peptide ligase. BH is found in all tissues in mammals as well as in many other eukaryotes. It forms a hexameric ring barrel structure with the active sites imbedded in the central channel. Some members of the C1 family are proteins classified as non-peptidase homologs which lack peptidase activity or have missing active site residues.

The putative Acetoin Utilization Protein (Acub) from Vibrio Cholerae contains a CBS pair domain.  The acetoin utilization protein plays a role in growth and sporulation on acetoin or butanediol for use as a carbon source. Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms.  It is used as an external energy store by a number of fermentive bacteria. Acetoin is produced by the decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate. Once superior carbon sources are exhausted, and the culture enters stationary phase, acetoin can be utilised in order to maintain the culture density. The conversion of acetoin into acetyl-CoA or 2,3-butanediol is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase complex and acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, respectively. Acetoin utilization proteins, acetylpolyamine amidohydrolases, and histone deacetylases are members of an ancient protein superfamily.This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains in the acetoin utilization proteins in bacteria. Acetoin is a product of fermentative metabolism in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms.  They produce acetoin as an external carbon storage compound and then later reuse it as a carbon and energy source during their stationary phase and sporulation. In addition these CBS domains are associated with a downstream ACT (aspartate kinase/chorismate mutase/TyrA) domain, which is linked to a wide range of metabolic enzymes that are regulated by amino acid concentration. Pairs of ACT domains bind specifically to a particular amino acid leading to regulation of the linked enzyme. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).

The putative Acetoin Utilization Protein (Acub) from Vibrio Cholerae contains a CBS pair domain.  The acetoin utilization protein plays a role in growth and sporulation on acetoin or butanediol for use as a carbon source. Acetoin is an important physiological metabolite excreted by many microorganisms.  It is used as an external energy store by a number of fermentive bacteria. Acetoin is produced by the decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate. Once superior carbon sources are exhausted, and the culture enters stationary phase, acetoin can be utilised in order to maintain the culture density. The conversion of acetoin into acetyl-CoA or 2,3-butanediol is catalysed by the acetoin dehydrogenase complex and acetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, respectively.

This is an essential step in the bacterial synthesis of cobalamine (B12). The insertion of cobalt requires a complex composed of three polypeptides, cobN, cobS, and cobT. Also included in this family are protoporphyrin IX magnesium chelatases involved in the synthesis of chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll, specifically the large (chlH or bchH) subunits.They are thought to bind both the protoporphyrin and the magnesium ion.

Cobaltochelatase is a complex enzyme that catalyzes the insertion of cobalt into hydrogenobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, resulting in cobyrinic acid, as demonstrated for Pseudomonas denitrificans. This is an essential step in the bacterial synthesis of cobalamine (B12). The insertion of cobalt requires a complex composed of three polypeptides, cobN, cobS, and cobT. Also included in this family are protoporphyrin IX magnesium chelatases involved in the synthesis of chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll, specifically the large (chlH or bchH) subunits.They are thought to bind both the protoporphyrin and the magnesium ion. Hydrolysis of ATP by the smaller subunits in the complex may trigger a conformational change that results in the insertion of the ion into the protoporphyrin scaffold. Cryo electron microscopy studies have suggested that a distinct bchH C-terminal domain may bind tightly to the N-terminal domain upon substrate binding, requiring a substantial conformational change of the bchH subunit.

Examples of heterodimeric members with alpha and beta subunits include arsenite oxidase, and tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase (FDH-T) while   heterotrimeric members containing alpha, beta, and gamma subunits include formate dehydrogenase-N (FDH-N), and nitrate reductase (NarGHI).  The beta subunit contains four Fe4/S4 and/or Fe3/S4 clusters which transfer the electrons from the alpha subunit to a hydrophobic integral membrane protein, presumably a cytochrome containing two b-type heme groups.

tr|F4BXJ2|F4BXJ2_METSG	cd08490		The substrate-binding component of an uncharacterized ABC-type nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide-like import system contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This CD represents the substrate-binding domain of an uncharacterized ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide-like transporter. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA and the dipeptide-binding protein DppA show significant sequence similarity to NikA, the initial nickel receptor. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand-binding domains from ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

Domains in this subgroup are uncharacterized members of the Peptidase family C25 N-terminal domain family. Peptidases family C25 are a unique class of cysteine proteases, exemplified by gingipain, which is produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. gingivalis is one of the primary gram-negative pathogens that causes periodontitis, a disease that is also associated with other diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Gingipains are a group of extracellular Arg- and Lys-specific proteinases called Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp); RgpA and RgpB are homologous Arg-specific gingipains encoded by two closely related genes, rgpA and rgpB, while Lys-specific gingipain is encoded by the single kgp gene. Mutant studies have shown that, among the large quantities of proteolytic enzymes produced by P. gingivalis, these three proteases are major virulence factors of this bacterium. All three genes encode an N-terminal pre-pro fragment, followed by the protease domain; however, rgpA and kgp also encode additional C-terminal HA (hemaglutinin/adhesion) subunits which consist of several sequence-related adhesion domains. Although unique, their cysteine protease active site residues (His and Cys) forming the catalytic dyad are well-conserved, cleaving the C-terminal peptide bond with Arg or Lys residues. Gingipains are evolutionarily related to other highly specific proteases including caspases, clostripain, legumains, and separase. Gingipains function by dysregulating host defense and inflammatory responses, and degrading host proteins, e.g. tissue, cells, matrix, plasma and immunological proteins. They are proposed to enhance gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) production through activation of the kallikrein/kinin pathways, thus increasing vascular permeability and causing gingival inflammation, a distinctive feature of periodontitis. RgpA and RgpB are also able to cleave and activate coagulation factors IX and X in order to activate prothrombin to produce thrombin, which in turn increases production of GCF. The gingipains also play a pivotal role in the survival of P. gingivalis in the host by attacking the host defense system through cleavage of several immunological molecules, while at the same time evading the host-immune response by dysregulating the cytokine network.

This GlmM protein catalyzes the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate. The first-characterized bacterial GlmM protein is modeled by TIGR01455. These two families are members of the larger phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase family (characterized by three domains: pfam02878, pfam02879 and pfam02880), but are not nearest neighbors to each other. This model also includes a number of sequences from non-archaea in the Bacteroides, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Spirochaetes lineages. Evidence supporting their inclusion in this equivalog as having the same activity comes from genomic context and phylogenetic profiling. A large number of these organisms are known to produce exo-polysaccharide and yet only appeared to contain the GlmS enzyme of the GlmSMU pathway for UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (GenProp0750). In some organisms including Leptospira, this archaeal GlmM is found adjacent to the GlmS as well as a putative GlmU non-orthologous homolog.

The PYR domain is found in many key metabolic enzymes which use TPP (also known as thiamine diphosphate) as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. For many of these enzymes the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits. However, for the homodimeric enzyme Desulfovibrio africanus pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), each active site lies at the interface of the PYR and PP domains from the same subunit. This subfamily includes proteins characterized as pyruvate NADP+ oxidoreductase (PNO). PFOR and PNO catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA, a crucial step in many metabolic pathways. The facultative anaerobic mitochondrion of the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis oxidizes pyruvate with PNO.

PaaK catalyzes the first step in the aromatic degradation pathway, by converting phenylacetic acid (PA) into phenylacetyl-CoA (PA-CoA). Phenylacetate-CoA ligase has been found in proteobacteria as well as gram positive prokaryotes. The enzyme is specifically induced after aerobic growth in a chemically defined medium containing PA or phenylalanine (Phe) as the sole carbon source. PaaKs are members of the adenylate-forming enzyme (AFE) family.

DJ-1 has been shown to possess chaperone activity. DJ-1 is preferentially expressed in the testis and moderately in other tissues; it is induced together with genes involved in oxidative stress response. The Drosophila homologue (DJ-1A) plays an essential role in oxidative stress response and neuronal maintenance. Inhibition of DJ-1A function through RNAi, results in the cellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species, organismal hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, and dysfunction and degeneration of dopaminergic and photoreceptor neurons.

This family includes the N-terminal domain of NikR, C-terminal domains of antitoxins HicB and ParD, as well as antitoxin MazE, and similar proteins, all of which belong to the ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) family of transcription factors. NikR is a nickel-responsive transcription factor that consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding RHH domain and a C-terminal metal-binding domain (MBD) with four nickel ions. In Helicobacter pylori, which colonizes the gastric epithelium of humans leading to gastric ulcers and gastric cancers, NikR (HpNikR) regulates multiple genes. It regulates urease, which protects H. pylori from acidic shock at low pH, by converting urea to ammonia and bicarbonate. It also plays a complex role in the intracellular physiology of nickel; occupation of nickel-binding sites results in NikR binding to its operator in the nickel permease nikABCDE promoter. Thus, there is weaker repression of NikABCDE transcription at low intracellular free nickel concentrations while strong repression prevails at higher concentrations, which would be potentially toxic. Antitoxin HicB is part of the HicAB toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, where the toxins are RNases, found in many bacteria. In the pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, the HicAB system plays a role in regulating the frequency of persister cells and may therefore play a role in disease. Structural studies of Yersinia pestis HicB show that it acts as an autoregulatory protein and HicA acts as an mRNase. In Escherichia coli, an excess of HicA has been shown to de-repress a HicB-DNA complex and restore transcription of HicB. Similarly, Caulobacter crescentus ParD antitoxin neutralizes the effect of cognate ParE toxin. In Bacillus subtilis, during stress conditions, antitoxin MazE binds to toxin MazF, an mRNA interferase, and inactivates it and cleaves mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner, resulting in cellular growth arrest.

They catalyze the successive 1'-4 condensation of the 5-carbon IPP to allylic substrates geranyl-, farnesyl-, or geranylgeranyl-diphosphate. Isoprenoid chain elongation reactions proceed via electrophilic alkylations in which a new carbon-carbon single bond is generated through interaction between a highly reactive electron-deficient allylic carbocation and an electron-rich carbon-carbon double bond. The catalytic site consists of a large central cavity formed by mostly antiparallel alpha helices with two aspartate-rich regions (DDXX(XX)D) located on opposite walls. These residues mediate binding of prenyl phosphates via bridging Mg2+ ions, inducing proposed conformational changes that close the active site to solvent, protecting and stabilizing reactive carbocation intermediates.

The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis.

It has been shown that in Escherichia coli RPS2 is essential for the binding of ribosomal protein S1 to the 30s ribosomal subunit. In humans, most likely in all vertebrates, and perhaps in all metazoans, the protein also functions as the 67 kDa laminin receptor (LAMR1 or 67LR), which is formed from a 37 kDa precursor, and is overexpressed in many tumors. 67LR is a cell surface receptor which interacts with a variety of ligands, laminin-1 and others. It is assumed that the ligand interactions are mediated via the conserved C-terminus, which becomes extracellular as the protein undergoes conformational changes which are not well understood. Specifically, a conserved palindromic motif, LMWWML, may participate in the interactions. 67LR plays essential roles in the adhesion of cells to the basement membrane and subsequent signalling events, and has been linked to several diseases.

Some well studied proteins in this CD are AHBA_synthase, protein product of pleiotropic regulatory gene degT,  Arnb aminotransferase and pilin glycosylation protein. The prototype of this family, the AHBA_synthase, is a dimeric PLP dependent enzyme. AHBA_syn is the terminal enzyme of 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) formation which is involved in the biosynthesis of ansamycin antibiotics, including rifamycin B. Some members of this CD are involved in 4-amino-6-deoxy-monosaccharide D-perosamine synthesis. Perosamine is an important element in the glycosylation of several cell products, such as antibiotics and lipopolysaccharides of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The pilin glycosylation protein encoded by gene pglA, is a galactosyltransferase involved in pilin glycosylation. Additionally, this CD consists of ArnB (PmrH) aminotransferase, a 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose lipopolysaccharide-modifying enzyme.

These two are quite closely related to one another, so extension of this annotation to other members of the family in unsupported without additional independent evidence. The neuD gene is often observed in close proximity to the neuABC genes for the biosynthesis of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-sialic acid), and NeuD sequences from these organisms were used to construct the seed for this model. Nevertheless, there are numerous instances of sequences identified by this model which are observed in a different genomic context (although almost universally in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis-related loci), as well as in genomes for which the biosynthesis of sialic acid (SA) is undemonstrated. Even in the cases where the association with SA biosynthesis is strong, it is unclear in the literature whether the biological substrate is SA iteself, CMP-SA, or a polymer containing SA. Similarly, it is unclear to what extent the enzyme has a preference for acetylation at the 7, 8 or 9 positions. In the absence of evidence of association with SA, members of this family may be involved with the acetylation of differring sugar substrates, or possibly the delivery of alternative acyl groups. The closest related sequences to this family (and those used to root the phylogenetic tree constructed to create this model) are believed to be succinyltransferases involved in lysine biosynthesis. These proteins contain repeats of the bacterial transferase hexapeptide (pfam00132), although often these do not register above the trusted cutoff.		CDD:469633

All of these exhibit aminopeptidase and deblocking activities. The HmTET is a broad substrate aminopeptidase capable of degrading large peptides. PhTET2, which shares 24% identity with HmTET, is a cobalt-activated peptidase and possibly a deblocking aminopeptidase, assembled as a 12-subunit tetrahedral dodecamer, while PhTET1 can be alternatively assembled as a tetrahedral dodecamer or as an octahedral tetracosameric structure. The active site in such a self-compartmentalized complex is located on the inside such that substrate sizes are limited, indicating function as possible peptide scavengers. PhTET2 cleaves polypeptides by a nonprocessive mechanism, preferring N-terminal hydrophobic or uncharged polar amino acids. Streptococcus pneumoniae PepA (SpPepA) also forms dodecamer with tetrahedral architecture, and exhibits selective substrate specificity to acidic amino acids with the preference to glutamic acid, with the substrate binding S1 pocket containing an Arg allows electrostatic interactions with the N-terminal acidic residue in the substrate. The YsdC gene is conserved in a number of thermophiles, archaea and pathogenic bacterial species; the closest structural homolog is Thermotoga maritima FrwX (34% identity), which is annotated as either a cellulase or an endoglucanase, and is possibly involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis or degradation.

Mechanistically, they share the transfer of a single electron from the iron-sulfur cluster to SAM, which leads to its reductive cleavage to methionine and a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, which, in turn, abstracts a hydrogen from the appropriately positioned carbon atom. Depending on the enzyme, SAM is consumed during this process or it is restored and reused. Radical SAM enzymes catalyze steps in metabolism, DNA repair, the biosynthesis of vitamins and coenzymes, and the biosynthesis of many antibiotics.

Synthesis of acetyl-CoA is carried out in a two-step reaction. In the first step, the enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of acetyl-AMP intermediate from acetate and ATP. In the second step, acetyl-AMP reacts with CoA to produce acetyl-CoA. This enzyme is widely present in all living organisms. The activity of this enzyme is crucial for maintaining the required levels of acetyl-CoA, a key intermediate in many important biosynthetic and catabolic processes. Acetyl-CoA is used in the biosynthesis of glucose, fatty acids, and cholesterol. It can also be used in the production of energy in the citric acid cycle.

L12p is homologous to P1 and P2 but is not homologous to bacterial L7/L12. It is located in the L12 stalk, with proteins L10, L11, and 23S rRNA. L12p is the only protein in the ribosome to occur as multimers, always appearing as sets of dimers. Recent data indicate that most archaeal species contain six copies of L12p (three homodimers), while eukaryotes have four copies (two heterodimers), and bacteria may have four or six copies (two or three homodimers), depending on the species. The organization of proteins within the stalk has been characterized primarily in bacteria, where L7/L12 forms either two or three homodimers and each homodimer binds to the extended C-terminal helix of L10. L7/L12 is attached to the ribosome through L10 and is the only ribosomal protein that does not directly interact with rRNA. Archaeal L12p is believed to function in a similar fashion. However, hybrid ribosomes containing the large subunit from E. coli with an archaeal stalk are able to bind archaeal and eukaryotic elongation factors but not bacterial elongation factors. In several mesophilic and thermophilic archaeal species, the binding of 23S rRNA to protein L11 and to the L10/L12p pentameric complex was found to be temperature-dependent and cooperative.

Ribosomal protein L11, together with proteins L10 and L7/L12, and 23S rRNA, form the L7/L12 stalk on the surface of the large subunit of the ribosome. The homologous eukaryotic cytoplasmic protein is also called 60S ribosomal protein L12, which is distinct from the L12 involved in the formation of the L7/L12 stalk. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of L11 is essential for binding 23S rRNA, while the N-terminal domain (NTD) contains the binding site for the antibiotics thiostrepton and micrococcin. L11 and 23S rRNA form an essential part of the GTPase-associated region (GAR). Based on differences in the relative positions of the L11 NTD and CTD during the translational cycle, L11 is proposed to play a significant role in the binding of initiation factors, elongation factors, and release factors to the ribosome. Several factors, including the class I release factors RF1 and RF2, are known to interact directly with L11. In eukaryotes, L11 has been implicated in regulating the levels of ubiquinated p53 and MDM2 in the MDM2-p53 feedback loop, which is responsible for apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

tr|F4C0V0|F4C0V0_METSG	cl11960		Immunoglobulin domain. The non-classical mouse MHC class I (MHC-I) molecule Qa-1b is a non-polymorphic MHC molecule with an important function in innate immunity. It binds and presents signal peptides of classical MHC-I molecules at the cell surface and, as such, act as an indirect sensor for the normal expression of MHC-I molecules. This signal peptide dominantly accommodated in the groove of Qa-1b is called Qdm, for Qa-1 determinant modifier, and its amino acid sequence AMAPRTLLL is highly conserved among mammalian species. The Qdm/Qa-1b complex serves as a ligand for the germ-line encoded heterodimeric CD94/NKG2A receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and activated CD8+ T cells and transduces inhibitory signals to these lymphocytes. Thus, upon binding, Qa-1b signals NK cells not to engage in cell lysis. The molecular basis of Qa-1b function is unclear.		CDD:472250

The S8 family has an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. Serine acts as a nucleophile, aspartate as an electrophile, and histidine as a base. The S53 family contains a catalytic triad Glu/Asp/Ser with an additional acidic residue Asp in the oxyanion hole, similar to that of subtilisin.  The serine residue here is the nucleophilic equivalent of the serine residue in the S8 family, while glutamic acid has the same role here as the histidine base.   However, the aspartic acid residue that acts as an electrophile is quite different.  In S53, it follows glutamic acid, while in S8 it precedes histidine.

This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding domain of nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide transport systems, which function in the import of nickel and peptides, and other closely related proteins. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is a periplasmic component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system OppABCDEF consisting of five subunits: two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Similar to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems, nickel transporter is comprised of five subunits NikABCDE: the two pore-forming integral inner membrane proteins NikB and NikC; the two inner membrane-associated proteins with ATPase activity NikD and NikE; and the periplasmic nickel binding NikA, which is the initial nickel receptor that controls the chemotactic response away from nickel.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand binding domains of ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

RNAP IV and/or V might be involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation of endogenous repetitive elements, silencing of transgenes, regulation of flowering-time genes, inducible regulation of adjacent gene pairs, and spreading of mobile silencing signals. The subunit compositions of RNAP IV and V reveal that they evolved from RNAP II.		CDD:473139												
tr|G3XHD3|G3XHD3_BOWSE	cl29012		Largest subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP), C-terminal domain. Archaeal RNA polymerase (RNAP), like bacterial RNAP, is a large multi-subunit complex responsible for the synthesis of all RNAs in the cell. The relative positioning of the RNAP core is highly conserved between archaeal RNAP and the three classes of eukaryotic RNAPs. In archaea, the largest subunit is split into two polypeptides, A' and A'', which are encoded by separate genes in an operon. Sequence alignments reveal that the archaeal A'' subunit corresponds to the C-terminal one-third of the RNAPII largest subunit (Rpb1). In subunit A'', several loops in the jaw domain are shorter. The RNAPII Rpb1 interacts with the second-largest subunit (Rpb2) to form the DNA entry and RNA exit channels in addition to the catalytic center of RNA synthesis.		CDD:355888

Typically, the vWA domain is made up of approximately 200 amino acid residues folded into a classic a/b para-rossmann type of fold. The vWA domain, since its discovery, has drawn great interest because of its widespread occurrence and its involvement in a wide variety of important cellular functions. These include basal membrane formation, cell migration, cell differentiation, adhesion, haemostasis, signaling, chromosomal stability, malignant transformation and in immune defenses  In integrins these domains form heterodimers while in vWF it forms multimers. There are different interaction surfaces of this domain as seen by the various molecules it complexes with. Ligand binding in most cases is mediated by the presence of a metal ion dependent adhesion site termed as the MIDAS motif that is a characteristic feature of most, if not all A domains.

tr|G5HGM3|G5HGM3_9FIRM	cd00995		The substrate-binding domain of an ABC-type nickel/oligopeptide-like import system contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding domain of nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide transport systems, which function in the import of nickel and peptides, and other closely related proteins. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is a periplasmic component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system OppABCDEF consisting of five subunits: two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Similar to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems, nickel transporter is comprised of five subunits NikABCDE: the two pore-forming integral inner membrane proteins NikB and NikC; the two inner membrane-associated proteins with ATPase activity NikD and NikE; and the periplasmic nickel binding NikA, which is the initial nickel receptor that controls the chemotactic response away from nickel.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand binding domains of ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

Hydrolysis of ATP by the smaller subunits in the complex may trigger a conformational change that results in the insertion of the ion into the protoporphyrin scaffold.

Amino acid DH-like NAD(P)-binding domains are members of the Rossmann fold superfamily and include glutamate, leucine, and phenylalanine DHs, methylene tetrahydrofolate DH, methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin DH, methylene-tetrahydropholate DH/cyclohydrolase, Shikimate DH-like proteins, malate oxidoreductases, and glutamyl tRNA reductase. Amino acid DHs catalyze the deamination of amino acids to keto acids with NAD(P)+ as a cofactor. The NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily includes a wide variety of protein families including NAD(P)- binding domains of alcohol DHs, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate DH, lactate/malate DHs, formate/glycerate DHs, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate DH, amino acid DHs, repressor rex, NAD-binding potassium channel domain, CoA-binding, and ornithine cyclodeaminase-like domains. These domains have an alpha -beta-alpha configuration. NAD binding involves numerous hydrogen and van der Waals contacts.		CDD:133445			47.083	240.0	114.0	5.0	200.0	439.0	1.0	227.0	2.88e-91	274.0

tr|H8IAP7|H8IAP7_METCZ	cd00995		The substrate-binding domain of an ABC-type nickel/oligopeptide-like import system contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding domain of nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide transport systems, which function in the import of nickel and peptides, and other closely related proteins. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is a periplasmic component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system OppABCDEF consisting of five subunits: two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Similar to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems, nickel transporter is comprised of five subunits NikABCDE: the two pore-forming integral inner membrane proteins NikB and NikC; the two inner membrane-associated proteins with ATPase activity NikD and NikE; and the periplasmic nickel binding NikA, which is the initial nickel receptor that controls the chemotactic response away from nickel.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand binding domains of ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

This signal peptide dominantly accommodated in the groove of Qa-1b is called Qdm, for Qa-1 determinant modifier, and its amino acid sequence AMAPRTLLL is highly conserved among mammalian species. The Qdm/Qa-1b complex serves as a ligand for the germ-line encoded heterodimeric CD94/NKG2A receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and activated CD8+ T cells and transduces inhibitory signals to these lymphocytes.

The G-domain is composed of about 200 amino acid residues, arranged into a predominantly parallel six-stranded beta-sheet core surrounded by seven alpha helices. Non-catalytic domains II and III are beta-barrels of seven and six, respectively, antiparallel beta-strands that share an extended interface. Both non-catalytic domains are composed of about 100 amino acid residues. EF-Tu proteins exist in two principal conformations: a compact one, EF-Tu*GTP, with tight interfaces between all three domains and a high affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA; and an open one, EF-Tu*GDP, with essentially no G-domain-domain II interactions and a low affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA.

The subtilisin-like protease domain is located at the N-terminus and contains a protease-associated domain inserted into a loop.  There are three fibronectin type III (Fn) domains at the C-terminus. SCP binds to integrins with the help of Arg-Gly-Asp motifs which are thought to stabilize conformational changes required for substrate binding.  Peptidases S8 or Subtilases are a serine endo- and exo-peptidase clan. They have an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin.

Polyketide synthases produce polyketides in step by step mechanism that is similar to fatty acid synthesis. Enoyl reductase reduces a double to single bond. Erythromycin is one example of a polyketide generated by 3 complex enzymes (megasynthases). 2-enoyl thioester reductase (ETR) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent dependent conversion of trans-2-enoyl acyl carrier protein/coenzyme A (ACP/CoA) to acyl-(ACP/CoA) in fatty acid synthesis. 2-enoyl thioester reductase activity has been linked in  Candida tropicalis as essential in maintaining mitiochondrial respiratory function. This ETR family is a part of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, but lack the zinc coordination sites characteristic of the alcohol dehydrogenases in this family. NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases are the major enzymes in the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes or ketones. Alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver converts ethanol and NAD+ to acetaldehyde and NADH, while in yeast and some other microorganisms ADH catalyzes the conversion acetaldehyde to ethanol in alcoholic fermentation.   ADH is a member of the medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (MDR), which has a NAD(P)(H)-binding domain in a Rossmann fold of a beta-alpha form.  The NAD(H)-binding region is comprised of 2 structurally similar halves, each of which contacts a mononucleotide. The N-terminal catalytic domain has a distant homology  to GroES. These proteins typically form dimers (typically higher plants, mammals) or tetramers (yeast, bacteria), and have 2 tightly bound zinc atoms per subunit, a catalytic zinc at the active site, and a structural zinc in a lobe of the catalytic domain. NAD(H) binding occurs in the cleft between the catalytic  and coenzyme-binding domains, at the active site, and coenzyme binding induces a conformational closing of this cleft. Coenzyme binding typically precedes and contributes to substrate binding.		CDD:176179			41.837	294.0	161.0	5.0	5237.0	5521.0	1.0	293.0	1.3e-87	289.0

This group is composed of many different subtilisins: Pro-TK-subtilisin, subtilisin Carlsberg, serine protease Pb92 subtilisin, and BPN subtilisins just to name a few. Pro-TK-subtilisin is a serine protease from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis and consists of a signal peptide, a propeptide, and a mature domain.  TK-subtilisin is matured from pro-TK-subtilisin upon autoprocessing and degradation of the propeptide. Unlike other subtilisins though, the folding of the unprocessed form of pro-TK-subtilisin is induced by Ca2+ binding which is almost completed prior to autoprocessing. Ca2+ is required for activity unlike the bacterial subtilisins. The propeptide is not required for folding of the mature domain unlike the bacterial subtilases because of the stability produced from Ca2+ binding.  Subtilisin Carlsberg is extremely similar in structure to subtilisin BPN'/Novo thought it has a 30% difference in amino acid sequence.  The substrate binding regions are also similar and 2 possible Ca2+ binding sites have been identified recently. Subtilisin Carlsberg possesses the highest commercial importance as a proteolytic additive for detergents. Serine protease Pb92, the serine protease from the alkalophilic Bacillus strain PB92, also contains two calcium ions and the overall  folding of the polypeptide chain closely resembles that of the subtilisins.   Members of the peptidases S8 and S35 clan include endopeptidases, exopeptidases and also a tripeptidyl-peptidase. The S8 family has an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. The S53 family contains a catalytic triad Glu/Asp/Ser. The stability of these enzymes may be enhanced by calcium, some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity. Some members of this clan contain disulfide bonds. These enzymes can be intra- and extracellular, some function at extreme temperatures and pH values.

tr|I1T4P5|I1T4P5_9ROSI	cd04133		Rho-related protein from plants (Rop)-like. The Rop (Rho-related protein from plants) subfamily plays a role in diverse cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, pollen and vegetative cell growth, hormone responses, stress responses, and pathogen resistance. Rops are able to regulate several downstream pathways to amplify a specific signal by acting as master switches early in the signaling cascade. They transmit a variety of extracellular and intracellular signals. Rops are involved in establishing cell polarity in root-hair development, root-hair elongation, pollen-tube growth, cell-shape formation, responses to hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin, responses to abiotic stresses such as oxygen deprivation, and disease resistance and disease susceptibility. An individual Rop can have a unique function or an overlapping function shared with other Rop proteins; in addition, a given Rop-regulated function can be controlled by one or multiple Rop proteins. For example, Rop1, Rop3, and Rop5 are all involved in pollen-tube growth; Rop2 plays a role in response to low-oxygen environments, cell-morphology, and root-hair development; root-hair development is also regulated by Rop4 and Rop6; Rop6 is also responsible for ABA response, and ABA response is also regulated by Rop10. Plants retain some of the regulatory mechanisms that are shared by other members of the Rho family, but have also developed a number of unique modes for regulating Rops. Unique RhoGEFs have been identified that are exclusively active toward Rop proteins, such as those containing the domain PRONE (plant-specific Rop nucleotide exchanger). Most Rho proteins contain a lipid modification site at the C-terminus, with a typical sequence motif CaaX, where a = an aliphatic amino acid and X = any amino acid. Lipid binding is essential for membrane attachment, a key feature of most Rho proteins. Due to the presence of truncated sequences in this CD, the lipid modification site is not available for annotation.		CDD:206705			92.486	173.0	13.0	0.0	6.0	178.0	1.0	173.0	1.77e-135	374.0

NAD(+) synthase (EC 6.3.5.1), a homodimer, catalyzes the final step in the de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) biosynthesis, an amide transfer from either ammonia or glutamine to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). The conversion of NaAD to NAD(+) occurs via a NAD-adenylate intermediate and requires ATP and Mg(2+). The intermediate is subsequently cleaved into NAD(+) and AMP. In many prokaryotes, such as Escherichia coli, NAD synthase consists of a single domain and is strictly ammonia dependent. In contrast, eukaryotes and other prokaryotes have an additional N-terminal amidohydrolase domain that prefer glutamine. Interestingly, NAD(+) synthases in these prokaryotes, can also utilize ammonia as an amide source.		CDD:467484			42.424	264.0	135.0	3.0	268.0	530.0	1.0	248.0	9.17e-100	300.0

This subfamily is composed of predominantly prokaryotic 1,4 alpha glucan branching enzymes, also called glycogen branching enzymes.

Glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the formation of alpha-1,6 branch points in either glycogen or starch by cleavage of the alpha-1,4 glucosidic linkage, yielding a non-reducing end oligosaccharide chain, as well as the subsequent attachment of short glucosyl chains to the alpha-1,6 position. By increasing the number of non-reducing ends, glycogen is more reactive to synthesis and digestion as well as being more soluble. The N-terminal domain of the 1,4 alpha glucan branching enzyme may be related to the immunoglobulin and/or fibronectin type III superfamilies. These domains are associated with different types of catalytic domains at  either the N-terminal or C-terminal end and may be involved in homodimeric/tetrameric/dodecameric interactions.

The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the third step of glycogen biosynthesis by the cleavage of an alpha-(1,4)-glucosidic linkage and the formation a new alpha-(1,6)-branch by subsequent transfer of cleaved oligosaccharide. They are part of a group called branching enzymes which catalyze the formation of alpha-1,6 branch points in either glycogen or starch. This group includes proteins from bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.

tr|J7J1V9|J7J1V9_DESMD	cd05371		17hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (HSD10)-like, classical (c) SDRs. HSD10, also known as amyloid-peptide-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), was previously identified as a L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, HADH2. In fatty acid metabolism, HADH2 catalyzes the third step of beta-oxidation, the conversion of a hydroxyl to a keto group in the NAD-dependent oxidation of L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA. In addition to alcohol dehydrogenase and HADH2 activites, HSD10 has steroid dehydrogenase activity. Although the mechanism is unclear, HSD10 is implicated in the formation of amyloid beta-petide in the brain (which is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease). Although HSD10 is normally concentrated in the mitochondria, in the presence of amyloid beta-peptide it translocates into the plasma membrane, where it's action may generate cytotoxic aldehydes and may lower estrogen levels through its use of 17-beta-estradiol as a substrate. HSD10 is a member of the SRD family, but differs from other SDRs by the presence of two insertions of unknown function. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.

This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type oligopeptide transport system comprised of 5 subunits. The transport system OppABCDEF contains two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.

The structure of EF-G closely resembles that of the complex between EF-Tu and tRNA. This is an example of molecular mimicry; a protein domain evolved so that it mimics the shape of a tRNA molecule. EF-G in the GTP form binds to the ribosome, primarily through the interaction of its EF-Tu-like domain with the 50S subunit. The binding of EF-G to the ribosome in this manner stimulates the GTPase activity of EF-G. On GTP hydrolysis, EF-G undergoes a conformational change that forces its arm deeper into the A site on the 30S subunit. To accommodate this domain, the peptidyl-tRNA in the A site moves to the P site, carrying the mRNA and the deacylated tRNA with it. The ribosome may be prepared for these rearrangements by the initial binding of EF-G as well. The dissociation of EF-G leaves the ribosome ready to accept the next aminoacyl-tRNA into the A site.

The driving force of TRAP transporters is provided by electrochemical ion gradients (either protons or sodium ions) across the cytoplasmic membrane, rather than ATP hydrolysis. This substrate-binding domain belongs to the type 2 periplasmic binding fold protein superfamily (PBP2). The PBP2 proteins are typically comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap.

The formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase catalyzes the first step in methane formation from CO2 in methanogenic archaea and has a molybdopterin dinucleotide cofactor.

Members of this family also contain a large, periplasmic molybdenum-containing alpha subunit and may have a small gamma subunit as well.  Examples of heterodimeric members with alpha and beta subunits include arsenite oxidase, and tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase (FDH-T) while   heterotrimeric members containing alpha, beta, and gamma subunits include formate dehydrogenase-N (FDH-N), and nitrate reductase (NarGHI).  The beta subunit contains four Fe4/S4 and/or Fe3/S4 clusters which transfer the electrons from the alpha subunit to a hydrophobic integral membrane protein, presumably a cytochrome containing two b-type heme groups.

Each protein subunit, a four-helix bundle with a fifth short terminal helix, contains a dinuclear ferroxidase center (H type). Unique to this group of proteins is a third metal site in the ferroxidase center.

Bacterial micro-compartments are primitive protein-based organelles that sequester specific metabolic pathways in bacterial cells. The prototypical bacterial microcompartment is the carboxysome shell, a bacterial polyhedral organelle which increase the efficiency of CO2 fixation by encapsulating RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase. They can be divided into two types: alpha-type carboxysomes (alpha-cyanobacteria and proteobacteria) and beta-type carboxysomes (beta-cyanobacteria).  Potential functional differences between the two types are not yet fully understood. In addition to these proteins there are several homologous shell proteins including those found in pdu organelles involved in coenzyme B12-dependent degradation of 1,2-propanediol and eut organelles involved in the cobalamin-dependent degradation of ethanolamine. Structure evidence shows that several carboxysome shell proteins and their homologs (Csos1A, CcmK1,2,4, and PduU) exist as hexamers which might further assemble into extended, tightly packed layers hypothesized to represent the flat facets of the polyhedral organelles outer shell. Although it has been suggested that other homologous proteins in this family might also form hexamers and play similar functional roles in the construction of their corresponding organelle outer shells at present no experimental evidence directly supports this view.

MamE is a serine protease required to produce magnetite crystals in the magnetotactic bacterium M. magneticum. It is involved in localization of some proteins (at least MamA, MamC, MamF, MamI and MamJ) to the magnetosome, and likely cleaves at least itself, MamO and MamP. MamE-PDZ1 may bind MamB. Its autoproteolysis is stimulated by exogenous substrates or peptides that bind to its PDZ domains. Peptide binding to either the first or the second PDZ domain of MamE can activate proteolysis; activation through PDZ2 is much weaker. PDZ domains usually bind in a sequence-specific manner to short peptide sequences located at the C-terminal of their partner proteins (known as PDZ binding motifs). The PDZ superfamily includes canonical PDZ domains and as well as those with circular permutations and domain swapping of beta-strands. The canonical PDZ domain contains six beta-strands A-F and two alpha-helices (alpha-helix 1 and 2); arranged as A, B, C, alpha-helix 1, beta-strands D, E,  alpha-helix 2 and beta-strand F. This MamE-like PDZ domain 1 is a circularly permuted PDZ domain which places beta-strand A on the C-terminus.

This family represents the catalytic domain of alpha-lytic protease (alpha-LP) and its closely-related homologs. Alpha-lytic protease (EC 3.4.21.12; also called alpha-lytic endopeptidase), originally isolated from the myxobacterium Lysobacter enzymogenes, belongs to the MEROPS peptidase family S1, subfamily S1E (streptogrisin A subfamily). It is synthesized as a pro-enzyme, thus having two domains; the N-terminal pro-domain acts as a foldase, required transiently for the correct folding of the protease domain, and also acts as a potent inhibitor of the mature enzyme, while the C-terminal domain catalyzes the cleavage of peptide bonds. Members of the alpha-lytic protease subfamily include Nocardiopsis alba protease (NAPase), a secreted chymotrypsin from the alkaliphile Cellulomonas bogoriensis, streptogrisins (SPG-A, SPG-B, SPG-C, and SPG-D), and Thermobifida fusca protease A (TFPA). These serine proteases have characteristic kinetic stability, exhibited by their extremely slow unfolding kinetics. The active site, characteristic of serine proteases, contains the catalytic triad consisting of serine acting as a nucleophile, aspartate as an electrophile, and histidine as a base, all required for activity. This model represents the C-terminal catalytic domain of alpha-lytic proteases.		CDD:411050			29.6	125.0	76.0	8.0	137.0	252.0	62.0	183.0	1.28e-09	55.4

This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding domain of nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide transport systems, which function in the import of nickel and peptides, and other closely related proteins. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is a periplasmic component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system OppABCDEF consisting of five subunits: two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Similar to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems, nickel transporter is comprised of five subunits NikABCDE: the two pore-forming integral inner membrane proteins NikB and NikC; the two inner membrane-associated proteins with ATPase activity NikD and NikE; and the periplasmic nickel binding NikA, which is the initial nickel receptor that controls the chemotactic response away from nickel.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.

This group is distinct from TDHs that are members of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. This group has the NAD-binding motif and active site tetrad of the extended SDRs. Extended SDRs are distinct from classical SDRs. In addition to the Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet) core region typical of all SDRs, extended SDRs have a less conserved C-terminal extension of approximately 100 amino acids. Extended SDRs are a diverse collection of proteins, and include isomerases, epimerases, oxidoreductases, and lyases; they typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold, an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes is typically in the 15-30% range; they catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser and/or an Asn, contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Atypical SDRs generally lack the catalytic residues characteristic of the SDRs, and their glycine-rich NAD(P)-binding motif is often different from the forms normally seen in classical or extended SDRs. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN).

GK (EC 2.7.1.30), also called ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase, or glycerokinase, is a key enzyme in the regulation of glycerol uptake and metabolism. It catalyzes the Mg-ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to yield sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. It also catalyzes the phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone, L-glyceraldehyde and D-glyceraldehyde.  The subfamily includes GKs and GK-like proteins from all three kingdoms of living organisms. Metazoan GKs, coded by X chromosome-linked GK genes, and GK-like proteins, coded by autosomal testis-specific GK-like genes GK2, GK3 and Gykl1 (in mouse) are closely related to the bacterial GKs. The metazoan GKs do have GK enzymatic activity. However, the GK-like metazoan proteins do not exhibit GK activity and their biological functions are not yet clear. Some of them lack important functional residues involved in the binding of ADP and Mg2+, which may result in the loss of GK catalytic function.  Others that have conserved catalytic residues have lost their GK activity as well; the reason remains unclear. It has been suggested the conserved catalytic residues might facilitate them performing a distinct function. Under different conditions, GKs from different species may exist in different oligomeric states. Members of this subfamily belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site. This model includes both the N-terminal domain, which adopts a ribonuclease H-like fold, and the structurally related C-terminal domain.

LEC2 and ABI3 have been shown to be involved in seed development, while other members of the LAV family seem to have a more general role, being expressed in many organs during plant development.

Members of this family belong to the type 2 periplasmic-binding fold superfamily. PBP2 is comprised of two globular subdomains connected by a flexible hinge and bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. The majority of PBP2 proteins function in the uptake of small soluble substrates in eubacteria and archaea. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.		CDD:270304			38.83	376.0	215.0	9.0	61.0	431.0	2.0	367.0	4.7900000000000003e-110	327.0

Bacterial micro-compartments are primitive protein-based organelles that sequester specific metabolic pathways in bacterial cells. The prototypical bacterial microcompartment is the carboxysome shell, a bacterial polyhedral organelle which increase the efficiency of CO2 fixation by encapsulating RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase. They can be divided into two types: alpha-type carboxysomes (alpha-cyanobacteria and proteobacteria) and beta-type carboxysomes (beta-cyanobacteria).  Potential functional differences between the two types are not yet fully understood. In addition to these proteins there are several homologous shell proteins including those found in pdu organelles involved in coenzyme B12-dependent degradation of 1,2-propanediol and eut organelles involved in the cobalamin-dependent degradation of ethanolamine. Structure evidence shows that several carboxysome shell proteins and their homologs (Csos1A, CcmK1,2,4, and PduU) exist as hexamers which might further assemble into extended, tightly packed layers hypothesized to represent the flat facets of the polyhedral organelles outer shell. Although it has been suggested that other homologous proteins in this family might also form hexamers and play similar functional roles in the construction of their corresponding organelle outer shells at present no experimental evidence directly supports this view.

tr|M8DX24|M8DX24_9BACL	cd06905		Peptidase M14-like domain; uncharacterized subfamily. A functionally uncharacterized subgroup of the M14 family of metallocarboxypeptidases (MCPs). The M14 family are zinc-binding carboxypeptidases (CPs) which hydrolyze single, C-terminal amino acids from polypeptide chains, and have a recognition site for the free C-terminal carboxyl group, which is a key determinant of specificity. Two major subfamilies of the M14 family, defined based on sequence and structural homology, are the A/B and N/E subfamilies. Enzymes belonging to the A/B subfamily are normally synthesized as inactive precursors containing preceding signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal pro-region linked to the enzyme; these proenzymes are called procarboxypeptidases. The A/B enzymes can be further divided based on their substrate specificity; Carboxypeptidase A-like (CPA-like) enzymes favor hydrophobic residues while carboxypeptidase B-like (CPB-like) enzymes only cleave the basic residues lysine or arginine. The A forms have slightly different specificities, with Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) preferring aliphatic and small aromatic residues, and CPA2 preferring the bulky aromatic side chains. Enzymes belonging to the N/E subfamily enzymes are not produced as inactive precursors and instead rely on their substrate specificity and subcellular compartmentalization to prevent inappropriate cleavages. They contain an extra C-terminal transthyretin-like domain, thought to be involved in folding or formation of oligomers.  MCPs can also be classified based on their involvement in specific physiological processes; the pancreatic MCPs participate only in alimentary digestion and include carboxypeptidase A and B (A/B subfamily), while others, namely regulatory MCPs or the N/E subfamily, are involved in more selective reactions, mainly in non-digestive tissues and fluids, acting on blood coagulation/fibrinolysis, inflammation and local anaphylaxis, pro-hormone and neuropeptide processing, cellular response and others.   Another MCP subfamily, is that of succinylglutamate desuccinylase /aspartoacylase, which hydrolyzes N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), and deficiency in which is the established cause of Canavan disease. Another subfamily (referred to as subfamily C) includes an exceptional type of activity in the MCP family, that of dipeptidyl-peptidase activity of gamma-glutamyl-(L)-meso-diaminopimelate peptidase I which is involved in bacterial cell wall metabolism.

The G-domain is composed of about 200 amino acid residues, arranged into a predominantly parallel six-stranded beta-sheet core surrounded by seven alpha helices. Non-catalytic domains II and III are beta-barrels of seven and six, respectively, antiparallel beta-strands that share an extended interface. Both non-catalytic domains are composed of about 100 amino acid residues. EF-Tu proteins exist in two principal conformations: a compact one, EF-Tu*GTP, with tight interfaces between all three domains and a high affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA; and an open one, EF-Tu*GDP, with essentially no G-domain-domain II interactions and a low affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA.

SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type KRs have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.

tr|O54666|O54666_AMYMD	cd08956		beta-ketoacyl reductase (KR) domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS), subgroup 3, complex (x). Ketoreductase, a module of the multidomain polyketide synthase (PKS), has 2 subdomains, each corresponding  to a SDR family monomer. The C-terminal subdomain catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the beta-carbonyl of a polyketide to a hydroxyl group, a step in the biosynthesis of polyketides, such as erythromycin. The N-terminal subdomain, an interdomain linker, is a truncated Rossmann fold which acts to stabilizes the catalytic subdomain. Unlike typical SDRs, the isolated domain does not oligomerize but is composed of 2 subdomains, each resembling an SDR monomer. The active site resembles that of typical SDRs, except that the usual positions of the catalytic Asn and Tyr are swapped, so that the canonical YXXXK motif changes to YXXXN. Modular PKSs are multifunctional structures in which the makeup recapitulates that found in (and may have evolved from) FAS. In some instances, such as porcine FAS, an enoyl reductase (ER) module is inserted between the sub-domains. Fatty acid synthesis occurs via the stepwise elongation of a chain (which is attached to acyl carrier protein, ACP) with 2-carbon units. Eukaryotic systems consists of large, multifunctional synthases (type I) while bacterial, type II systems, use single function proteins. Fungal fatty acid synthesis uses a dodecamer of 6 alpha and 6 beta subunits. In mammalian type FAS cycles, ketoacyl synthase forms acetoacetyl-ACP which is reduced by the NADP-dependent beta-KR, forming beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP, which is in turn dehydrated by dehydratase to a beta-enoyl intermediate, which is reduced by NADP-dependent beta- ER. Polyketide synthesis also proceeds via the addition of 2-carbon units as in fatty acid synthesis. The complex SDR NADP-binding motif, GGXGXXG, is often present, but is not strictly conserved in each instance of the module. This subfamily includes KR domains found in many multidomain PKSs, including six of seven Sorangium cellulosum PKSs (encoded by spiDEFGHIJ) which participate in the synthesis of the polyketide scaffold of the cytotoxic spiroketal polyketide spirangien. These seven PKSs have either a single PKS module (SpiF), two PKR modules (SpiD,-E,-I,-J), or three PKS modules (SpiG,-H). This subfamily includes the second KR domains of SpiE,-G, I, and -J, both KR domains of SpiD, and the third KR domain of SpiH.

EF-Tu is one of the most abundant proteins in bacteria, as well as, one of the most highly conserved, and in a number of species the gene is duplicated with identical function. When bound to GTP, EF-Tu can form a complex with any (correctly) aminoacylated tRNA except those for initiation and for selenocysteine, in which case EF-Tu is replaced by other factors.

The G-domain is composed of about 200 amino acid residues, arranged into a predominantly parallel six-stranded beta-sheet core surrounded by seven alpha helices. Non-catalytic domains II and III are beta-barrels of seven and six, respectively, antiparallel beta-strands that share an extended interface. Both non-catalytic domains are composed of about 100 amino acid residues. EF-Tu proteins exist in two principal conformations: a compact one, EF-Tu*GTP, with tight interfaces between all three domains and a high affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA; and an open one, EF-Tu*GDP, with essentially no G-domain-domain II interactions and a low affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA.

Ncd is a spindle motor protein necessary for chromosome segregation in meiosis. KIFC2/KIFC3-like kinesins have been implicated in motility of the Golgi apparatus as well as dentritic and axonal transport in neurons. This catalytic (head) domain has ATPase activity and belongs to the larger group of P-loop NTPases. Kinesins are microtubule-dependent molecular motors that play important roles in intracellular transport and in cell division. In this subgroup the motor domain is found at the C-terminus (C-type). C-type kinesins are (-) end-directed motors, i.e. they transport cargo towards the (-) end of the microtubule. Kinesin motor domains hydrolyze ATP at a rate of about 80 per second, and move along the microtubule at a speed of about 6400 Angstroms per second. To achieve that, kinesin head groups work in pairs. Upon replacing ADP with ATP, a kinesin motor domain increases its affinity for microtubule binding and locks in place. Also, the neck linker binds to the motor domain, which repositions the other head domain through the coiled-coil domain close to a second tubulin dimer, about 80 Angstroms along the microtubule. Meanwhile, ATP hydrolysis takes place, and when the second head domain binds to the microtubule, the first domain again replaces ADP with ATP, triggering a conformational change that pulls the first domain forward.

LCL-type Condensation (C) domains catalyze peptide bond formation between two L-amino acids, ((L)C(L)). C-domains of NRPSs catalyze peptide bond formation within (usually) large multi-modular enzymatic complexes. NRPS can use a large variety of acyl monomers (approximately 500 different possible monomer substrates as opposed to the 20 standard amino acids in ribosomal protein synthesis) to construct bioactive secondary metabolites of 2 to 18 units long (with various activities such as antibiotic, antifungal, antitumor and immunosuppression). In addition to the LCL-type, there are various subtypes of C-domains such as the DCL-type which links an L-amino acid to the D-amino acid at the end of a growing peptide, starter C-domains which acylate the first amino acid with a beta-hydroxy carboxylic acid, and heterocyclization (Cyc) domains which catalyze both peptide bond formation and cyclization of Cys, Ser, or Thr residues. Typically, an NRPS module consists of an adenylation domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain (also known as thiolation (T) domain) and a C-domain. NRPS modules may also include specialized domains such as the terminal-module thioesterase (Te) domain that releases the product via hydrolysis or macrocyclization and any of various C-domain family members such as the epimerization (E) domain, the ester-bond forming C-domain, dual E/C (epimerization and condensation) domains, and the X-domain. Streptomyces globisporus SgcC5 is a free-standing NRPS condensation enzyme (rather than a modular NRPS), which catalyzes the condensation between the SgcC2-tethered (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine and (R)-1phenyl-1,2-ethanediol, forming an ester bond, during the synthesis of the chromoprotein enediyne antitumor antibiotic C-1027. It has some acceptor substrate promiscuity as it has been shown to also catalyze the formation of an amide bond between SgcC2-tethered (S)-3-chloro-5-hydroxy-beta-tyrosine and a mimic of the enediyne core acceptor substrate having an amine at its C-2 position. C-domains typically have a conserved HHxxxD motif at the active site; mutations in this motif can abolish or diminish condensation activity. An HHxx[SAG]DGxSx(6)[ED] motif is characteristic of LCL-type C-domains.		CDD:380454			37.731	432.0	254.0	5.0	531.0	952.0	1.0	427.0	3.46e-120	382.0

The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis.

The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins.

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD), are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1 and the vertebrate retroviruses. Ty3/Gypsy family widely distributed among the genomes of plants, fungi and animals.

Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP family), pyrimidine (PYR) binding domain, of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (IOR) alpha subunit (IOR-alpha), and related proteins, subfamily. The PYR domain is found in many key metabolic enzymes which use TPP (also known as thiamine diphosphate) as a cofactor. TPP binds in the cleft formed by a PYR domain and a PP domain. The PYR domain, binds the aminopyrimidine ring of TPP, the PP domain binds the diphosphate residue. A polar interaction between the conserved glutamate of the PYR domain and the N1' of the TPP aminopyrimidine ring is shared by most TPP-dependent enzymes, and participates in the activation of TPP. The PYR and PP domains have a common fold, but do not share strong sequence conservation. The PP domain is not included in this sub-family. Most TPP-dependent enzymes have the PYR and PP domains on the same subunit although these domains can be alternatively arranged in the primary structure. TPP-dependent enzymes are multisubunit proteins, the smallest catalytic unit being a dimer-of-active sites. For many of these enzymes the active sites lie between PP and PYR domains on different subunits. However, for the homodimeric enzyme Desulfovibrio africanus pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), each active site lies at the interface of the PYR and PP domains from the same subunit. This subfamily includes proteins characterized as pyruvate NADP+ oxidoreductase (PNO). PFOR and PNO catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA, a crucial step in many metabolic pathways. The facultative anaerobic mitochondrion of the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis oxidizes pyruvate with PNO. IOR catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of arylpyruvates, such as indolepyruvate or phenylpyruvate.		CDD:132917			37.423	163.0	97.0	3.0	9.0	169.0	1.0	160.0	3.2699999999999995e-48	159.0

Group I TRX is a small ancient protein that alter the redox state of target proteins via the reversible oxidation of an active site dithiol, present in a CXXC motif, partially exposed at the protein's surface. TRX reduces protein disulfide bonds, resulting in a disulfide bond at its active site. Oxidized TRX is converted to the active form by TRX reductase, using reducing equivalents derived from either NADPH or ferredoxins. By altering their redox state, TRX regulates the functions of at least 30 target proteins, some of which are enzymes and transcription factors. It also plays an important role in the defense against oxidative stress by directly reducing hydrogen peroxide and certain radicals, and by serving as a reductant for peroxiredoxins. At least two major types of functional TRXs have been reported in most organisms; in eukaryotes, they are located in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. Higher plants contain more types (at least 20 TRX genes have been detected in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana), two of which (types f amd m) are located in the same compartment, the chloroplast. Also included in the alignment are TRX-like domains which show sequence homology to TRX but do not contain the redox active CXXC motif.

Ribonuclease H (RNase H) enzymes are divided into two major families, Type 1 and Type 2, based on amino acid sequence similarities and biochemical properties. RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner in the presence of divalent cations. RNase H is widely present in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. RNase HI has also been observed as adjunct domains to the reverse transcriptase gene in retroviruses, in long-term repeat (LTR)-bearing and non-LTR retrotransposons. RNase HI in LTR retrotransposons perform degradation of the original RNA template, generation of a polypurine tract (the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis), and final removal of RNA primers from newly synthesized minus and plus strands. The catalytic residues for RNase H enzymatic activity, three aspartatic acids and one glutamic acid residue (DEDD) are unvaried across all RNase H domains. Phylogenetic patterns of RNase HI of LTR retroelements is classified into five major families, Ty3/Gypsy, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao, DIRS1, and the vertebrate retroviruses.

tr|Q8EN17|Q8EN17_OCEIH	cd05371		17hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (HSD10)-like, classical (c) SDRs. HSD10, also known as amyloid-peptide-binding alcohol dehydrogenase (ABAD), was previously identified as a L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, HADH2. In fatty acid metabolism, HADH2 catalyzes the third step of beta-oxidation, the conversion of a hydroxyl to a keto group in the NAD-dependent oxidation of L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA. In addition to alcohol dehydrogenase and HADH2 activites, HSD10 has steroid dehydrogenase activity. Although the mechanism is unclear, HSD10 is implicated in the formation of amyloid beta-petide in the brain (which is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease). Although HSD10 is normally concentrated in the mitochondria, in the presence of amyloid beta-peptide it translocates into the plasma membrane, where it's action may generate cytotoxic aldehydes and may lower estrogen levels through its use of 17-beta-estradiol as a substrate. HSD10 is a member of the SRD family, but differs from other SDRs by the presence of two insertions of unknown function. SDRs are a functionally diverse family of oxidoreductases that have a single domain with a structurally conserved Rossmann fold (alpha/beta folding pattern with a central beta-sheet), an NAD(P)(H)-binding region, and a structurally diverse C-terminal region. Classical SDRs are typically about 250 residues long, while extended SDRs are approximately 350 residues. Sequence identity between different SDR enzymes are typically in the 15-30% range, but the enzymes share the Rossmann fold NAD-binding motif and characteristic NAD-binding and catalytic sequence patterns. These enzymes catalyze a wide range of activities including the metabolism of steroids, cofactors, carbohydrates, lipids, aromatic compounds, and amino acids, and act in redox sensing. Classical SDRs have an TGXXX[AG]XG cofactor binding motif and a YXXXK active site motif, with the Tyr residue of the active site motif serving as a critical catalytic residue (Tyr-151, human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) numbering). In addition to the Tyr and Lys, there is often an upstream Ser (Ser-138, 15-PGDH numbering) and/or an Asn (Asn-107, 15-PGDH numbering) contributing to the active site; while substrate binding is in the C-terminal region, which determines specificity. The standard reaction mechanism is a 4-pro-S hydride transfer and proton relay involving the conserved Tyr and Lys, a water molecule stabilized by Asn, and nicotinamide. Extended SDRs have additional elements in the C-terminal region, and typically have a TGXXGXXG cofactor binding motif. Complex (multidomain) SDRs such as ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthase have a GGXGXXG NAD(P)-binding motif and an altered active site motif (YXXXN). Fungal type ketoacyl reductases have a TGXXXGX(1-2)G NAD(P)-binding motif. Some atypical SDRs have lost catalytic activity and/or have an unusual NAD(P)-binding motif and missing or unusual active site residues. Reactions catalyzed within the SDR family include isomerization, decarboxylation, epimerization, C=N bond reduction, dehydratase activity, dehalogenation, Enoyl-CoA reduction, and carbonyl-alcohol oxidoreduction.

Members of the family Matonaviridae have a (+)ssRNA genome enclosed by an icosahedral capsid. Matonaviridae has a single genus, Rubivirus, which contains three species: Rubivirus rubella (commonly called rubella virus), Rubivirus ruteetense (commonly called ruhugu virus), and Rubivirus strelense (commonly called rustrela virus). Rubella virus (RuV) is the etiologic agent of the disease rubella (also called German measles). RuV is transmitted only between humans via the respiratory route, and is the main cause of congenital rubella syndrome (severe congenital birth defects, miscarriage, and stillbirth) when infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. In vitro studies with cell lines showed that RuV has an apoptotic effect on certain cell types; there is evidence for a p53-dependent mechanism. The RdRp domain displays a right hand with three functional subdomains, called fingers, palm, and thumb. All RdRps contain conserved polymerase motifs (A-G), located in the palm (A-E motifs) and finger (F-G) subdomains.

RNase H is an endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA/DNA hybrid in a sequence non-specific manner. RNase H is involved in DNA replication, repair and transcription.

Despite the lack of amino acid sequence homology, type 1 and type 2 RNase H share a main-chain fold and steric configurations of the four acidic active-site (DEDD) residues and have the same catalytic mechanism and functions in cells. One of the important functions of RNase H is to remove Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. Most archaeal genomes contain only type 2 RNase H (RNase HII); however, a few contain RNase HI as well. Although archaeal RNase HI sequences conserve the DEDD active-site motif, they lack other common features important for catalytic function, such as the basic protrusion region. Archaeal RNase HI homologs are more closely related to retroviral RNase HI than bacterial and eukaryotic type I RNase H in enzymatic properties.

tr|Q8TN07|Q8TN07_METAC	cd00995		The substrate-binding domain of an ABC-type nickel/oligopeptide-like import system contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding domain of nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide transport systems, which function in the import of nickel and peptides, and other closely related proteins. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is a periplasmic component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system OppABCDEF consisting of five subunits: two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Similar to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems, nickel transporter is comprised of five subunits NikABCDE: the two pore-forming integral inner membrane proteins NikB and NikC; the two inner membrane-associated proteins with ATPase activity NikD and NikE; and the periplasmic nickel binding NikA, which is the initial nickel receptor that controls the chemotactic response away from nickel.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand binding domains of ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

C-terminal catalytic domain of the oxygenase alpha subunit of anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase (AntDO) and related Rieske-type non-heme iron aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenases (RHOs, also known as aromatic ring hydroxylating dioxygenases). RHOs utilize non-heme Fe(II) to catalyze the addition of hydroxyl groups to the aromatic ring, an initial step in the oxidative degradation of aromatic compounds. RHOs are composed of either two or three protein components, and are comprised of an electron transport chain (ETC) and an oxygenase. The ETC transfers reducing equivalents from the electron donor to the oxygenase component, which in turn transfers electrons to the oxygen molecules. The oxygenase components are oligomers, either (alpha)n or (alpha)n(beta)n.  The alpha subunits are the catalytic components and have an N-terminal domain, which binds a Rieske-like 2Fe-2S cluster, and the C-terminal catalytic domain which binds the non-heme Fe(II).

They have an Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad similar to that found in trypsin-like proteases, but do not share their three-dimensional structure and are not homologous to trypsin. The stability of subtilases may be enhanced by calcium, some members have been shown to bind up to 4 ions via binding sites with different affinity. Some members of this clan contain disulfide bonds.

Proteins in this group belong to the peptidase S8 family. C5a peptidase is a cell surface serine protease which specifically inactivates C5a [a chemotactic peptide, which attracts polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs)], by cleaving it to release a 7-residue carboxy-terminal fragment which contains the PMN binding site. The significance of the PA domain to these proteins has not been ascertained. It may be a protein-protein interaction domain. At peptidase active sites, the PA domain may participate in substrate binding and/or promoting conformational changes, which influence the stability and accessibility of the site to substrate.

Cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase; EC3.2.1.54), neopullulanase (NPase; EC 3.2.1.135), and maltogenic amylase (MA; EC 3.2.1.133) catalyze the hydrolysis of alpha-(1,4) glycosidic linkages on a number of substrates including cyclomaltodextrins (CDs), pullulan, and starch. These enzymes hydrolyze CDs and starch to maltose and pullulan to panose by cleavage of alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds whereas alpha-amylases essentially lack activity on CDs and pullulan. They also catalyze transglycosylation of oligosaccharides to the C3-, C4- or C6-hydroxyl groups of various acceptor sugar molecules. Since these proteins are nearly indistinguishable from each other, they are referred to as cyclomaltodextrinases (CMDs). The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.

tr|R6C9X5|R6C9X5_9CLOT	cd00995		The substrate-binding domain of an ABC-type nickel/oligopeptide-like import system contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding domain of nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide transport systems, which function in the import of nickel and peptides, and other closely related proteins. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA is a periplasmic component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system OppABCDEF consisting of five subunits: two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Similar to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems, nickel transporter is comprised of five subunits NikABCDE: the two pore-forming integral inner membrane proteins NikB and NikC; the two inner membrane-associated proteins with ATPase activity NikD and NikE; and the periplasmic nickel binding NikA, which is the initial nickel receptor that controls the chemotactic response away from nickel.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand binding domains of ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

Bacterial micro-compartments are primitive protein-based organelles that sequester specific metabolic pathways in bacterial cells. The prototypical bacterial microcompartment is the carboxysome shell, a bacterial polyhedral organelle which increase the efficiency of CO2 fixation by encapsulating RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase. They can be divided into two types: alpha-type carboxysomes (alpha-cyanobacteria and proteobacteria) and beta-type carboxysomes (beta-cyanobacteria).  Potential functional differences between the two types are not yet fully understood. In addition to these proteins there are several homologous shell proteins including those found in pdu organelles involved in coenzyme B12-dependent degradation of 1,2-propanediol and eut organelles involved in the cobalamin-dependent degradation of ethanolamine. Structure evidence shows that several carboxysome shell proteins and their homologs (Csos1A, CcmK1,2,4, and PduU) exist as hexamers which might further assemble into extended, tightly packed layers hypothesized to represent the flat facets of the polyhedral organelles outer shell. Although it has been suggested that other homologous proteins in this family might also form hexamers and play similar functional roles in the construction of their corresponding organelle outer shells at present no experimental evidence directly supports this view.

FTHFS is a highly expressed key enzyme in both the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of autotrophic CO2 fixation (acetogenesis) and the glycine synthase/reductase pathways of purinolysis. The key physiological role of this enzyme in acetogens is to catalyze the formylation of tetrahydrofolate, an initial step in the reduction of carbon dioxide and other one-carbon precursors to acetate.

This family includes the carboxyltransferase domains of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and the transcarboxylase (TC) 5S subunit.  Transcarboxylase 5S is a cobalt-dependent metalloenzyme subunit of the biotin-dependent transcarboxylase multienzyme complex. Transcarboxylase 5S transfers carbon dioxide from the 1.3S biotin to pyruvate in the second of two carboxylation reactions catalyzed by TC. The first reaction involves the transfer of carbon dioxide from methylmalonyl-CoA to the 1.3S biotin, and is catalyzed by the 12S subunit.  These two steps allow a carboxylate group to be transferred from oxaloacetate to propionyl-CoA to yield pyruvate and methylmalonyl-CoA.  The catalytic domain of transcarboxylase 5S has a canonical TIM-barrel fold with a large C-terminal extension that forms a funnel leading to the active site.  Transcarboxylase 5S forms a homodimer and there are six dimers per complex.  In addition to the catalytic domain, transcarboxylase 5S has several other domains including a carbamoyl-phosphate synthase domain, a biotin carboxylase domain, a carboxyltransferase domain, and an ATP-grasp domain.  Pyruvate carboxylase, like TC, is a biotin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate.  In mammals, PC has critical roles in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, glyceroneogenesis, and insulin secretion.  Inherited PC deficiencies are linked to serious diseases in humans such as lactic acidemia, hypoglycemia, psychomotor retardation, and death.  PC is a single-chain enzyme and is active only in its homotetrameric form.  PC has three domains, an N-terminal biotin carboxylase domain, a carboxyltransferase domain (this alignment model), and a C-terminal biotin-carboxyl carrier protein domain.

These members all share a conserved  triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain consisting of a core beta(8)-alpha(8) motif with the eight parallel beta strands forming an enclosed barrel surrounded by eight alpha helices.  The domain has a catalytic center containing a divalent cation-binding site formed by a cluster of invariant residues that cap the core of the barrel.

They all belong to the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family of chaperones that assist in protein folding and assembly, and can direct incompetent ""client"" proteins towards degradation. Typically, HSP70s have a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD). The nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD. The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Hsp70 chaperone activity is regulated by various co-chaperones: J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs); for Escherichia coli DnaK, these are the DnaJ and GrpE, respectively."

This family represents the periplasmic substrate-binding component of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type oligopeptide transport system comprised of 5 subunits. The transport system OppABCDEF contains two homologous integral membrane proteins OppB and OppF that form the translocation pore; two homologous nucleotide-binding domains OppD and OppF that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP; and the substrate-binding protein or receptor OppA that determines the substrate specificity of the transport system. The dipeptide (DppA) and oligopeptide (OppA) binding proteins differ in several ways. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis.  Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand-binding domains from ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators, and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

Acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), also known as acetyl-CoA decarbonylase, is found in acetogenic and methanogenic organisms and is responsible for the synthesis and breakdown of acetyl-CoA.  ACS forms a heterotetramer with carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) consisting of two ACS and two CODH subunits. CODH reduces carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and ACS then synthesizes acetyl-CoA from carbon monoxide, CoA, and a methyl group donated by another protein (CoFeSP).  ACS has three structural domains, an N-terminal rossman fold domain with a helical region at its N-terminus which interacts with CODH, and two alpha + beta fold domains.  A Ni-Fe-S center referred to as the A-cluster is located in the C-terminal domain. A large cavity exists between the three domains which may bind CoA.		CDD:474039

The 20S proteasome, multisubunit proteolytic complex, is the central enzyme for non-lysosomal protein degradation in both the cytosol and the nucleus. It is composed of 28 subunits arranged as four homoheptameric rings that stack on top of one another forming an elongated alpha-beta-beta-alpha cylinder with a central cavity. The proteasome alpha and beta subunits are both members of the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn)-hydrolase superfamily. Their N-terminal threonine residues are exposed as a nucleophile in peptide bond hydrolysis. Mammals have 7 alpha and 7 beta proteasome subunits while archaea have one of each.

Members of this family also contain a large, periplasmic molybdenum-containing alpha subunit and may have a small gamma subunit as well.  Examples of heterodimeric members with alpha and beta subunits include arsenite oxidase, and tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase (FDH-T) while   heterotrimeric members containing alpha, beta, and gamma subunits include formate dehydrogenase-N (FDH-N), and nitrate reductase (NarGHI).  The beta subunit contains four Fe4/S4 and/or Fe3/S4 clusters which transfer the electrons from the alpha subunit to a hydrophobic integral membrane protein, presumably a cytochrome containing two b-type heme groups. The reducing equivalents are then transferred to menaquinone, which finally reduces the electron-accepting enzyme system.		CDD:355383

tr|V4JAW4|V4JAW4_9BACT	cd04623		Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains present in bacteria and eukaryotes. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).

tr|V4L783|V4L783_9BACT	cd08498		The substrate-binding component of an uncharacterized ABC-type nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide-like import system contains the type 2 periplasmic binding fold. This CD represents the substrate-binding domain of an uncharacterized ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type nickel/dipeptide/oligopeptide-like transporter. The oligopeptide-binding protein OppA and the dipeptide-binding protein DppA show significant sequence similarity to NikA, the initial nickel receptor. The DppA binds dipeptides and some tripeptides and is involved in chemotaxis toward dipeptides, whereas the OppA binds peptides of a wide range of lengths (2-35 amino acid residues) and plays a role in recycling of cell wall peptides, which precludes any involvement in chemotaxis. Most of other periplasmic binding proteins are comprised of only two globular subdomains corresponding to domains I and III of the dipeptide/oligopeptide binding proteins. The structural topology of these domains is most similar to that of the type 2 periplasmic binding proteins (PBP2), which are responsible for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as phosphate, sulfate, polysaccharides, lysine/arginine/ornithine, and histidine.  The PBP2 bind their ligand in the cleft between these domains in a manner resembling a Venus flytrap. After binding their specific ligand with high affinity, they can interact with a cognate membrane transport complex comprised of two integral membrane domains and two cytoplasmically located ATPase domains. This interaction triggers the ligand translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane energized by ATP hydrolysis.  Besides transport proteins, the PBP2 superfamily includes the ligand-binding domains from ionotropic glutamate receptors, LysR-type transcriptional regulators,  and unorthodox sensor proteins involved in signal transduction.

Domains in this subgroup are uncharacterized members of the Peptidase family C25 N-terminal domain family. Peptidases family C25 are a unique class of cysteine proteases, exemplified by gingipain, which is produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. gingivalis is one of the primary gram-negative pathogens that causes periodontitis, a disease that is also associated with other diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Gingipains are a group of extracellular Arg- and Lys-specific proteinases called Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp); RgpA and RgpB are homologous Arg-specific gingipains encoded by two closely related genes, rgpA and rgpB, while Lys-specific gingipain is encoded by the single kgp gene. Mutant studies have shown that, among the large quantities of proteolytic enzymes produced by P. gingivalis, these three proteases are major virulence factors of this bacterium. All three genes encode an N-terminal pre-pro fragment, followed by the protease domain; however, rgpA and kgp also encode additional C-terminal HA (hemaglutinin/adhesion) subunits which consist of several sequence-related adhesion domains. Although unique, their cysteine protease active site residues (His and Cys) forming the catalytic dyad are well-conserved, cleaving the C-terminal peptide bond with Arg or Lys residues. Gingipains are evolutionarily related to other highly specific proteases including caspases, clostripain, legumains, and separase. Gingipains function by dysregulating host defense and inflammatory responses, and degrading host proteins, e.g. tissue, cells, matrix, plasma and immunological proteins. They are proposed to enhance gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) production through activation of the kallikrein/kinin pathways, thus increasing vascular permeability and causing gingival inflammation, a distinctive feature of periodontitis. RgpA and RgpB are also able to cleave and activate coagulation factors IX and X in order to activate prothrombin to produce thrombin, which in turn increases production of GCF. The gingipains also play a pivotal role in the survival of P. gingivalis in the host by attacking the host defense system through cleavage of several immunological molecules, while at the same time evading the host-immune response by dysregulating the cytokine network.

The G-domain is composed of about 200 amino acid residues, arranged into a predominantly parallel six-stranded beta-sheet core surrounded by seven alpha helices. Non-catalytic domains II and III are beta-barrels of seven and six, respectively, antiparallel beta-strands that share an extended interface. Both non-catalytic domains are composed of about 100 amino acid residues. EF-Tu proteins exist in two principal conformations: a compact one, EF-Tu*GTP, with tight interfaces between all three domains and a high affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA; and an open one, EF-Tu*GDP, with essentially no G-domain-domain II interactions and a low affinity for aminoacyl-tRNA.

RUN domain, named after RPIP8 (Rap2 interacting protein 8), UNC-14 and NESCA (new molecule containing SH3 at the carboxyl-terminus), is a less conserved protein motif that comprises six conserved regions, which in some proteins have considerable insertions between them. The domain core is thought to take up a predominantly alpha fold, with basic amino acids in regions A and D possibly playing a functional role in interactions with Ras GTPases. RUN domains are often found in proteins linked particularly to the functions of GTPases in the Rap and Rab families, suggesting the RUN domain may be involved in Rab-mediated membrane trafficking, possibly as a Rab-binding site.

PARG1 was originally cloned as an interaction partner of PTPL1, an intracellular protein-tyrosine phosphatase. PARG1 interacts with Rap2, also a member of the Ras small GTPase superfamily whose exact function is unknown, and shows strong preference for Rho. Small GTPases cluster into distinct families, and all act as molecular switches, active in their GTP-bound form but inactive when GDP-bound. The Rho family of GTPases activates effectors involved in a wide variety of developmental processes, including regulation of cytoskeleton formation, cell proliferation and the JNK signaling pathway.

SeviL is a dimeric member of the beta-trefoil superfamily and shows no interaction with GM1 due to steric hindrance with the sialic acid branch that is absent from GM1b. Thus, SeviL has a strong selectivity for asialo-GM1 over the closely related GM1. Moreover, SeviL displayed significant apoptotic effects against various cultured cell lines (human breast, ovarian, and colonic cancer) that possess asialo-GM1 oligosaccharide at the cell surface. This unusual specificity makes SeviL of great interest for the detection and control of certain cancer cells, and cells of the immune system, that display asialo-GM1. Furthermore, SeviL showed dose- and time-dependent activation of kinase MKK3/6, p38 MAPK, and caspase-3/9.

Papain is an endopeptidase with specific substrate preferences, primarily for bulky hydrophobic or aromatic residues at the S2 subsite, a hydrophobic pocket in papain that accommodates the P2 sidechain of the substrate (the second residue away from the scissile bond). Most members of the papain subfamily are endopeptidases. Some exceptions to this rule can be explained by specific details of the catalytic domains like the occluding loop in cathepsin B which confers an additional carboxydipeptidyl activity and the mini-chain of cathepsin H resulting in an N-terminal exopeptidase activity. Papain-like CPs have different functions in various organisms. Plant CPs are used to mobilize storage proteins in seeds. Parasitic CPs act extracellularly to help invade tissues and cells, to hatch or to evade the host immune system. Mammalian CPs are primarily lysosomal enzymes with the exception of cathepsin W, which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. They are responsible for protein degradation in the lysosome. Papain-like CPs are synthesized as inactive proenzymes with N-terminal propeptide regions, which are removed upon activation. In addition to its inhibitory role, the propeptide is required for proper folding of the newly synthesized enzyme and its stabilization in denaturing pH conditions. Residues within the propeptide region also play a role in the transport of the proenzyme to lysosomes or acidified vesicles. Also included in this subfamily are proteins classified as non-peptidase homologs, which lack peptidase activity or have missing active site residues.

This model summarizes an uncharacterized family of proteins similar to stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflK/C (SPFH) and podocin. The conserved domain common to the SPFH superfamily has also been referred to as the Band 7 domain. Many superfamily members are associated with lipid rafts. Individual proteins of the SPFH superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes. Microdomains formed from flotillin proteins may in addition be dynamic units with their own regulatory functions. Flotillins have been implicated in signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeleton rearrangement and are known to interact with a variety of proteins. Stomatin interacts with and regulates members of the degenerin/epithelia Na+ channel family in mechanosensory cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrate neurons and participates in trafficking of Glut1 glucose transporters. Prohibitin may act as a chaperone for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins. Prokaryotic HflK/C plays a role in the decision between lysogenic and lytic cycle growth during lambda phage infection. Flotillins have been implicated in the progression of prion disease, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease and, in cancer invasion and metastasis.

Amino acid dehydrogenase (DH) is a widely distributed family of enzymes that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of an amino acid to its keto acid and ammonia with concomitant reduction of NADP+. Glutamate DH is a multidomain enzyme that catalyzes the reaction from glutamate to 2-oxyoglutarate and ammonia in the presence of NAD or NADP. It is present in all organisms. Enzymes involved in ammonia assimilation are typically NADP+-dependent, while those involved in glutamate catabolism are generally NAD+-dependent.

Amino acid DHs catalyze the deamination of amino acids to keto acids with NAD(P)+ as a cofactor. The NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily includes a wide variety of protein families including NAD(P)- binding domains of alcohol DHs, tyrosine-dependent oxidoreductases, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate DH, lactate/malate DHs, formate/glycerate DHs, siroheme synthases, 6-phosphogluconate DH, amino acid DHs, repressor rex, NAD-binding potassium channel domain, CoA-binding, and ornithine cyclodeaminase-like domains.

GK (EC 2.7.1.30), also called ATP:glycerol 3-phosphotransferase, or glycerokinase, is a key enzyme in the regulation of glycerol uptake and metabolism. It catalyzes the Mg-ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to yield sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. It also catalyzes the phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone, L-glyceraldehyde and D-glyceraldehyde.  The subfamily includes GKs and GK-like proteins from all three kingdoms of living organisms. Metazoan GKs, coded by X chromosome-linked GK genes, and GK-like proteins, coded by autosomal testis-specific GK-like genes GK2, GK3 and Gykl1 (in mouse) are closely related to the bacterial GKs. The metazoan GKs do have GK enzymatic activity. However, the GK-like metazoan proteins do not exhibit GK activity and their biological functions are not yet clear. Some of them lack important functional residues involved in the binding of ADP and Mg2+, which may result in the loss of GK catalytic function.  Others that have conserved catalytic residues have lost their GK activity as well; the reason remains unclear. It has been suggested the conserved catalytic residues might facilitate them performing a distinct function. Under different conditions, GKs from different species may exist in different oligomeric states. Members of this subfamily belong to the FGGY family of carbohydrate kinases, the monomers of which contain two large domains, which are separated by a deep cleft that forms the active site.

This GlmM protein catalyzes the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate. The first-characterized bacterial GlmM protein is modeled by TIGR01455. These two families are members of the larger phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase family (characterized by three domains: pfam02878, pfam02879 and pfam02880), but are not nearest neighbors to each other. This model also includes a number of sequences from non-archaea in the Bacteroides, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Spirochaetes lineages. Evidence supporting their inclusion in this equivalog as having the same activity comes from genomic context and phylogenetic profiling. A large number of these organisms are known to produce exo-polysaccharide and yet only appeared to contain the GlmS enzyme of the GlmSMU pathway for UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (GenProp0750). In some organisms including Leptospira, this archaeal GlmM is found adjacent to the GlmS as well as a putative GlmU non-orthologous homolog. Phylogenetic profiling of the GlmS-only pattern using PPP identifies members of this archaeal GlmM family as the highest-scoring result.
