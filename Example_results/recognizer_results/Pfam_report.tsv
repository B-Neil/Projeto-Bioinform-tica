tr|A0B5W5|A0B5W5_METTP	pfam03063	Prismane/CO dehydrogenase family (Provisional)	Prismane/CO dehydrogenase family. This family includes both hybrid-cluster proteins and the beta chain of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. The hybrid-cluster proteins contain two Fe/S centres - a [4Fe-4S] cubane cluster, and a hybrid [4Fe-2S-2O] cluster. The physiological role of this protein is as yet unknown, although a role in nitrate/nitrite respiration has been suggested. The prismane protein from Escherichia coli was shown to contain hydroxylamine reductase activity (NH2OH + 2e + 2 H+ -> NH3 + H2O). This activity is rather low. Hydroxylamine reductase activity was also found in CO-dehydrogenase in which the active site Ni was replaced by Fe. The CO dehydrogenase contains a Ni-3Fe-2S-3O centre.

tr|A0LP29|A0LP29_SYNFM	cl09928		N/A. This model describes a subset of formate dehydrogenase alpha chains found mainly in proteobacteria but also in Aquifex. The alpha chain contains domains for molybdopterin dinucleotide binding and molybdopterin oxidoreductase (pfam01568 and pfam00384, respectively). The holo-enzyme also contains beta and gamma subunits of 32 and 20 kDa. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of formate (produced from pyruvate during anaerobic growth) to carbon dioxide with the concomitant release of two electrons and two protons. The electrons are utilized mainly in the nitrate respiration by nitrate reductase. In E. coli and Salmonella, there are two forms of the formate dehydrogenase, one induced by nitrate which is strictly anaerobic (fdn), and one incuced during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth (fdo). This subunit is one of only three proteins in E. coli which contain selenocysteine. This model is well-defined, with a large, unpopulated trusted/noise gap.

The BTB (for BR-C, ttk and bab) or POZ (for Pox virus and Zinc finger) domain is present near the N-terminus of a fraction of zinc finger (pfam00096) proteins and in proteins that contain the pfam01344 motif such as Kelch and a family of pox virus proteins. The BTB/POZ domain mediates homomeric dimerization and in some instances heteromeric dimerization. The structure of the dimerized PLZF BTB/POZ domain has been solved and consists of a tightly intertwined homodimer. The central scaffolding of the protein is made up of a cluster of alpha-helices flanked by short beta-sheets at both the top and bottom of the molecule. POZ domains from several zinc finger proteins have been shown to mediate transcriptional repression and to interact with components of histone deacetylase co-repressor complexes including N-CoR and SMRT. The POZ or BTB domain is also known as BR-C/Ttk or ZiN.		CDD:395526	Bacteria	2	40.171	117.0	58.0	2.0	173.0	289.0	1.0	105.0	1.1100000000000001e-29	108.0

This family includes the beta chain of 6,7-dimethyl-8- ribityllumazine synthase EC:2.5.1.9, an enzyme involved in riboflavin biosynthesis. The family also includes a subfamily of distant archaebacterial proteins that may also have the same function for example Swiss:O28856. The family contains a number of different subsets including a family of proteins comprising archaeal lumazine and riboflavin synthases, type I lumazine synthases, and the eubacterial type II lumazine synthases. It has been established that lumazine synthase catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin in plants and microorganizms. The type I lumazine synthases area active in pentameric or icosahedral quaternary assemblies, whereas the type II are decameric. Brucella, a bacterial genus that causes brucellosis, and other Rhizobiales have an atypical riboflavin metabolic pathway. Brucella spp code for both a type-I and a type-II lumazine synthase, and it has been shown that at least one of these two has to be present in order for Brucella to be viable, showing that in the case of Brucella flavin metabolism is implicated in bacterial virulence.

The histidine phosphatase superfamily is so named because catalysis centres on a conserved His residue that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle. Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue. Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue. The superfamily may be divided into two main branches.The smaller branch 2 contains predominantly eukaryotic proteins. The catalytic functions in members include phytase, glucose-1-phosphatase and multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase.

tr|B9XA39|B9XA39_PEDPL	pfam12951	autotransporter-associated beta strand repeat-containing protein	Passenger-associated-transport-repeat. This Autotransporter-associated beta strand repeat model represents a core 32-residue region of a class of bacterial protein repeat found in one to 30 copies per protein. Most proteins with a copy of this repeat have domains associated with membrane autotransporters (pfam03797). The repeats occur with a periodicity of 60 to 100 residues. A pattern of sequence conservation is that every second residue is well-conserved across most of the domain. These repeats as likely to have a beta-helical structure. This repeat plays a role in the efficient transport of autotransporter virulence factors to the bacterial surface during growth and infection. The repeat is always associated with the passenger domain of the autotransporter. For these reasons it has been coined the Passenger-associated Transport Repeat (PATR). The mechanism by which the PATR motif promotes transport is uncertain but it is likely that the conserved glycines (see HMM Logo) are required for flexibility of folding and that this folding drives secretion. Autotransporters that contain PATR(s) associate with distinct virulence traits such as subtilisin (S8) type protease domains and polymorphic outer-membrane protein repeats, whilst SPATE (S6) type protease and lipase-like autotransporters do not tend to contain PATR motifs.

SARS-CoV non-structural proteins (Nsps) are encoded in ORF1a and ORF1b. Post infection, the SARS-CoV genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm of the cell and translated into two long polyproteins (pps), pp1a and pp1ab. Papain-like protease (PLpro) is one of two SARS-CoV proteases which process these polyproteins; it cleaves pp1a at three sites, releasing Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp3. Nsp3 is a large multi-functional multi-domain protein which is an essential component of the replication/transcription complex (RTC). This ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain (sometimes referred to as Ubl2, the second Ubl domain of Nsp3) is located N-terminal to the PLpro domain of Nsp3. In addition to being a protease, SARS-CoV PLpro is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), and may be involved in subverting cellular ubiquitination machinery to facilitate viral replication.

This is a family of SusD-like proteins, one member of which, BT1043, is an outer membrane lipoprotein involved in host glycan metabolism. The structures of this and SusD-homologs in the family are dominated by tetratrico peptide repeats that may facilitate association with outer membrane beta-barrel transporters required for glycan uptake. The structure of BT1043 complexed with N-acetyllactosamine reveals that recognition is mediated via hydrogen bonding interactions with the reducing end of beta-N-acetylglucosamine, suggesting a role in binding glycans liberated from the mucin polypeptide. Mammalian distal gut bacteria have an expanded capacity to utilize glycans. In the absence of dietary sources, some species rely on host-derived mucosal glycans. The ability of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent human gut symbiont, to forage host glycans contributes to both its ability to persist within an individual host and its ability to be transmitted naturally to new hosts at birth.

tr|C7X600|C7X600_9BACT	pfam07980	RagB/SusD family nutrient uptake outer membrane protein	SusD family. This domain is found in bacterial cell surface proteins such SusD and SusD-like proteins as well RagB, outer membrane surface receptor antigen. Bacteroidetes, one of the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut, are Gram-negative saccharolytic microorganizms that utilize a diverse array of glycans. Hence, they express starch-utilization system (Sus) for glycan uptake. SusD has 551 amino acids, and is almost entirely alpha-helical, with 22 alpha-helices, eight of which form 4 tetra-trico peptide repeats (TPRs: helix-turn-helix motifs involved in protein-protein interactions). The four TPRs pack together to create a right-handed super-helix. This is predicted to mediate the formation of SusD and SusC porin complex at the cell surface. The interaction between SusC and TPR1/TPR2 region of SusD is predicted to be of functional importance since it allows SusD to be in position for oligosaccharide capture from other Sus lipoproteins and delivery of these glycans to the SusC porin. The non-TPR containing portion of SusD is where starch binding occurs. The binding site is a shallow surface cavity located on top of TPR1. SusD homologs such as SusD-like proteins have a critical role in carbohydrate acquisition. Both SusD and its homologs, contain 15-20 residues at the N-terminus that might be a flexible linker region, anchoring the protein to the membrane and the glycan-binding domain. Other homologs to SusD have been examined in Porphyromonas gingivalis such as RagB, an immunodominant outer-membrane surface receptor antigen. Structural characterization of RagB shows substantial similarity with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron SusD (i.e alpha-helices and TPR regions). Based on this structural similarity, functional studies suggest that, RagB binding of glycans occurs at pockets on the molecular surface that are distinct from those of SusD.

tr|D2QSI0|D2QSI0_SPILD	cl21747		starch binding outer membrane protein SusD. This is a family of SusD-like proteins, one member of which, BT1043, is an outer membrane lipoprotein involved in host glycan metabolism. The structures of this and SusD-homologs in the family are dominated by tetratrico peptide repeats that may facilitate association with outer membrane beta-barrel transporters required for glycan uptake. The structure of BT1043 complexed with N-acetyllactosamine reveals that recognition is mediated via hydrogen bonding interactions with the reducing end of beta-N-acetylglucosamine, suggesting a role in binding glycans liberated from the mucin polypeptide. Mammalian distal gut bacteria have an expanded capacity to utilize glycans. In the absence of dietary sources, some species rely on host-derived mucosal glycans. The ability of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent human gut symbiont, to forage host glycans contributes to both its ability to persist within an individual host and its ability to be transmitted naturally to new hosts at birth.

tr|D2QSI0|D2QSI0_SPILD	pfam07980	RagB/SusD family nutrient uptake outer membrane protein	SusD family. This domain is found in bacterial cell surface proteins such SusD and SusD-like proteins as well RagB, outer membrane surface receptor antigen. Bacteroidetes, one of the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut, are Gram-negative saccharolytic microorganizms that utilize a diverse array of glycans. Hence, they express starch-utilization system (Sus) for glycan uptake. SusD has 551 amino acids, and is almost entirely alpha-helical, with 22 alpha-helices, eight of which form 4 tetra-trico peptide repeats (TPRs: helix-turn-helix motifs involved in protein-protein interactions). The four TPRs pack together to create a right-handed super-helix. This is predicted to mediate the formation of SusD and SusC porin complex at the cell surface. The interaction between SusC and TPR1/TPR2 region of SusD is predicted to be of functional importance since it allows SusD to be in position for oligosaccharide capture from other Sus lipoproteins and delivery of these glycans to the SusC porin. The non-TPR containing portion of SusD is where starch binding occurs. The binding site is a shallow surface cavity located on top of TPR1. SusD homologs such as SusD-like proteins have a critical role in carbohydrate acquisition. Both SusD and its homologs, contain 15-20 residues at the N-terminus that might be a flexible linker region, anchoring the protein to the membrane and the glycan-binding domain. Other homologs to SusD have been examined in Porphyromonas gingivalis such as RagB, an immunodominant outer-membrane surface receptor antigen. Structural characterization of RagB shows substantial similarity with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron SusD (i.e alpha-helices and TPR regions). Based on this structural similarity, functional studies suggest that, RagB binding of glycans occurs at pockets on the molecular surface that are distinct from those of SusD.

tr|D2R336|D2R336_PIRSD	pfam12951	autotransporter-associated beta strand repeat-containing protein	Passenger-associated-transport-repeat. This Autotransporter-associated beta strand repeat model represents a core 32-residue region of a class of bacterial protein repeat found in one to 30 copies per protein. Most proteins with a copy of this repeat have domains associated with membrane autotransporters (pfam03797). The repeats occur with a periodicity of 60 to 100 residues. A pattern of sequence conservation is that every second residue is well-conserved across most of the domain. These repeats as likely to have a beta-helical structure. This repeat plays a role in the efficient transport of autotransporter virulence factors to the bacterial surface during growth and infection. The repeat is always associated with the passenger domain of the autotransporter. For these reasons it has been coined the Passenger-associated Transport Repeat (PATR). The mechanism by which the PATR motif promotes transport is uncertain but it is likely that the conserved glycines (see HMM Logo) are required for flexibility of folding and that this folding drives secretion. Autotransporters that contain PATR(s) associate with distinct virulence traits such as subtilisin (S8) type protease domains and polymorphic outer-membrane protein repeats, whilst SPATE (S6) type protease and lipase-like autotransporters do not tend to contain PATR motifs.

Mutation of the SCARECROW (SCR) gene results in a radial pattern defect, loss of a ground tissue layer, in the root. The PAT1 protein is involved in phytochrome A signal transduction. A sequence, structure and evolutionary analysis showed that the GRAS family emerged in bacteria and belongs to the Rossmann-fold, AdoMET (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase superfamily. All bacterial, and a subset of plant GRAS proteins, are predicted to be active and function as small-molecule methylases. Several plant GRAS proteins lack one or more AdoMet (SAM)-binding residues while preserving their substrate-binding residues. Although GRAS proteins are implicated to function as transcriptional factors, the above analysis suggests that they instead might either modify or bind small molecules.

Fascins function in the organization of two major forms of actin-based structures: dynamic, cortical cell protrusions and cytoplasmic microfilament bundles. The cortical structures, which include filopodia, spikes, lamellipodial ribs, oocyte microvilli and the dendrites of dendritic cells, have roles in cell-matrix adhesion, cell interactions and cell migration, whereas the cytoplasmic actin bundles appear to participate in cell architecture. Dictyostelium hisactophilin, another actin-binding protein, is a submembranous pH sensor that signals slight changes of the H+ concentration to actin by inducing actin polymerization and binding to microfilaments only at pH values below seven. Members of this family are histidine rich, typically contain the repeated motif of HHXH.		CDD:461865	Bacteria	2	23.684	114.0	83.0	3.0	822.0	935.0	2.0	111.0	2.75e-07	49.3

Alpha-2-macroglobulins (A2Ms) are plasma proteins that trap and inhibit a broad range of proteases and are major components of the eukaryotic innate immune system. However, A2M-like proteins were identified in pathogenically invasive bacteria and species that colonize higher eukaryotes. Bacterial A2Ms are located in the periplasm where they are believed to provide protection to the cell by trapping external proteases through a covalent interaction with an activated thioester. This domain is found on the C-terminal region in A2Ms in bacteria. Structure analysis of Salmonella enterica ser A2Ms (SA-A2Ms) show that they are composed of 13 domains, all of which fold as variants of beta sandwiches with the exception of the TED, which consists of 14 alpha helices. Most of the beta sandwich domains appear to serve a structural role and are referred to as the macroglobulin-like (MG) domains. This is the MG10 domain.

Alpha-2-macroglobulins (A2Ms) are plasma proteins that trap and inhibit a broad range of proteases and are major components of the eukaryotic innate immune system. However, A2M-like proteins were identified in pathogenically invasive bacteria and species that colonize higher eukaryotes. This domain is found in eukaryotic and bacterial proteins. In human A2Ms, this domain is termed macroglobulin-like (MG) domain 2 and in Salmonella enterica ser A2Ms, this is domain 4.

In Oenococcus oeni FtsH is involved in protection against environmental stress, and shows increased expression under heat or osmotic stress.

Domains in this subgroup are uncharacterized members of the Peptidase family C25 N-terminal domain family. Peptidases family C25 are a unique class of cysteine proteases, exemplified by gingipain, which is produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. gingivalis is one of the primary gram-negative pathogens that causes periodontitis, a disease that is also associated with other diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Gingipains are a group of extracellular Arg- and Lys-specific proteinases called Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp); RgpA and RgpB are homologous Arg-specific gingipains encoded by two closely related genes, rgpA and rgpB, while Lys-specific gingipain is encoded by the single kgp gene. Mutant studies have shown that, among the large quantities of proteolytic enzymes produced by P. gingivalis, these three proteases are major virulence factors of this bacterium. All three genes encode an N-terminal pre-pro fragment, followed by the protease domain; however, rgpA and kgp also encode additional C-terminal HA (hemaglutinin/adhesion) subunits which consist of several sequence-related adhesion domains. Although unique, their cysteine protease active site residues (His and Cys) forming the catalytic dyad are well-conserved, cleaving the C-terminal peptide bond with Arg or Lys residues. Gingipains are evolutionarily related to other highly specific proteases including caspases, clostripain, legumains, and separase. Gingipains function by dysregulating host defense and inflammatory responses, and degrading host proteins, e.g. tissue, cells, matrix, plasma and immunological proteins. They are proposed to enhance gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) production through activation of the kallikrein/kinin pathways, thus increasing vascular permeability and causing gingival inflammation, a distinctive feature of periodontitis. RgpA and RgpB are also able to cleave and activate coagulation factors IX and X in order to activate prothrombin to produce thrombin, which in turn increases production of GCF. The gingipains also play a pivotal role in the survival of P. gingivalis in the host by attacking the host defense system through cleavage of several immunological molecules, while at the same time evading the host-immune response by dysregulating the cytokine network.

This family consists of several eukaryotic transcription elongation Spt4 proteins as well as archaebacterial RpoE2. Three transcription-elongation factors Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are conserved among eukaryotes and are essential for transcription via the modulation of chromatin structure. Spt4 and Spt5 are tightly associated in a complex, while the physical association of the Spt4-Spt5 complex with Spt6 is considerably weaker. It has been demonstrated that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 play roles in transcription elongation in both yeast and humans including a role in activation by Tat. It is known that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are general transcription-elongation factors, controlling transcription both positively and negatively in important regulatory and developmental roles. RpoE2 is one of 13 subunits in the archaeal RNA polymerase. These proteins contain a C4-type zinc finger, and the structure has been solved in. The structure reveals that Spt4-Spt5 binding is governed by an acid-dipole interaction between Spt5 and Spt4, and the complex binds to and travels along the elongating RNA polymerase. The Spt4-Spt5 complex is likely to be an ancient, core component of the transcription elongation machinery.		CDD:399233	Archaea	2157	31.169	77.0	35.0	3.0	3.0	61.0	1.0	77.0	4.33e-12	53.1

tr|F4BVE1|F4BVE1_METSG	pfam01458	SufD family Fe-S cluster assembly protein	SUF system FeS cluster assembly, SufBD. Iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters are important cofactors for numerous proteins involved in electron transfer, in redox and non-redox catalysis, in gene regulation, and as sensors of oxygen and iron. These functions depend on the various FeS cluster prosthetic groups, the most common being [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S]. FeS cluster assembly is a complex process involving the mobilization of Fe and S atoms from storage sources, their assembly into [Fe-S] form, their transport to specific cellular locations, and their transfer to recipient apoproteins. So far, three FeS assembly machineries have been identified, which are capable of synthesising all types of [Fe-S] clusters: ISC (iron-sulphur cluster), SUF (sulphur assimilation), and NIF (nitrogen fixation) systems. The SUF system is an alternative pathway to the ISC system that operates under iron starvation and oxidative stress. It is found in eubacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (plastids). The SUF system is encoded by the suf operon (sufABCDSE), and the six encoded proteins are arranged into two complexes (SufSE and SufBCD) and one protein (SufA). SufS is a pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP) protein displaying cysteine desulphurase activity. SufE acts as a scaffold protein that accepts S from SufS and donates it to SufA. SufC is an ATPase with an unorthodox ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-like component. SufA is homologous to IscA, acting as a scaffold protein in which Fe and S atoms are assembled into [FeS] cluster forms, which can then easily be transferred to apoproteins targets. This entry represents SufB and SufD proteins, which are homologous, and form part of the SufBCD complex in the SUF system. SufB accepts sulfur transferred from SufE, whereas SufD may play a role in iron acquisition.		CDD:460219	cellular organisms	131567	33.913	230.0	132.0	5.0	152.0	374.0	2.0	218.0	5.46e-60	192.0

The prismane protein from Escherichia coli was shown to contain hydroxylamine reductase activity (NH2OH + 2e + 2 H+ -> NH3 + H2O). This activity is rather low. Hydroxylamine reductase activity was also found in CO-dehydrogenase in which the active site Ni was replaced by Fe. The CO dehydrogenase contains a Ni-3Fe-2S-3O centre.

It is predicted to form an all beta fold with up to 11 strands and is secreted to the extracellular compartment. The beta-strand folding produces a hydrophobic pocket which appears to bind soluble haem. This is consistent with the predominant architectures where the protein is associated with cytochromes or enzymatic domains whose activity involves redox or electron transfer reactions potentially as a direct participant in the electron transfer process. The DOMON domain superfamily, of which this is just one member, shows (1) multiple hydrophobic residues that contribute to the hydrophobic core of the strands of the beta-sandwich, and small residues found at the boundaries of strands and loops, (2) a strongly conserved charged residue (usually arginine/lysine) at the end of strand 9, which possibly stabilizes the loop between 9 and 10, and (3) a polar residue (usually histidine, lysine or arginine), that interacts or coordinates with ligands. The suggested superfamily includes both haem- and sugar-binding members: the haem-binding families being the ethyl-Benzoate dehydrogenase family EB_dh, pfam09459, the cellobiose dehydrogenase family CBDH and this family, and the sugar-binding families being the xylanases, CBM_4_9, pfam02018.

tr|F4BXV1|F4BXV1_METSG	cl03181		Peptidase C25 family N-terminal domain, found in Arg-gingipain (Rgp), Lys-gingipain (Kgp) and related proteins. Domains in this subgroup are uncharacterized members of the Peptidase family C25 N-terminal domain family. Peptidases family C25 are a unique class of cysteine proteases, exemplified by gingipain, which is produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis. P. gingivalis is one of the primary gram-negative pathogens that causes periodontitis, a disease that is also associated with other diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Gingipains are a group of extracellular Arg- and Lys-specific proteinases called Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp); RgpA and RgpB are homologous Arg-specific gingipains encoded by two closely related genes, rgpA and rgpB, while Lys-specific gingipain is encoded by the single kgp gene. Mutant studies have shown that, among the large quantities of proteolytic enzymes produced by P. gingivalis, these three proteases are major virulence factors of this bacterium. All three genes encode an N-terminal pre-pro fragment, followed by the protease domain; however, rgpA and kgp also encode additional C-terminal HA (hemaglutinin/adhesion) subunits which consist of several sequence-related adhesion domains. Although unique, their cysteine protease active site residues (His and Cys) forming the catalytic dyad are well-conserved, cleaving the C-terminal peptide bond with Arg or Lys residues. Gingipains are evolutionarily related to other highly specific proteases including caspases, clostripain, legumains, and separase. Gingipains function by dysregulating host defense and inflammatory responses, and degrading host proteins, e.g. tissue, cells, matrix, plasma and immunological proteins. They are proposed to enhance gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) production through activation of the kallikrein/kinin pathways, thus increasing vascular permeability and causing gingival inflammation, a distinctive feature of periodontitis. RgpA and RgpB are also able to cleave and activate coagulation factors IX and X in order to activate prothrombin to produce thrombin, which in turn increases production of GCF. The gingipains also play a pivotal role in the survival of P. gingivalis in the host by attacking the host defense system through cleavage of several immunological molecules, while at the same time evading the host-immune response by dysregulating the cytokine network.

tr|F4C0V0|F4C0V0_METSG	cl11960		Immunoglobulin domain. The non-classical mouse MHC class I (MHC-I) molecule Qa-1b is a non-polymorphic MHC molecule with an important function in innate immunity. It binds and presents signal peptides of classical MHC-I molecules at the cell surface and, as such, act as an indirect sensor for the normal expression of MHC-I molecules. This signal peptide dominantly accommodated in the groove of Qa-1b is called Qdm, for Qa-1 determinant modifier, and its amino acid sequence AMAPRTLLL is highly conserved among mammalian species. The Qdm/Qa-1b complex serves as a ligand for the germ-line encoded heterodimeric CD94/NKG2A receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and activated CD8+ T cells and transduces inhibitory signals to these lymphocytes. Thus, upon binding, Qa-1b signals NK cells not to engage in cell lysis. The molecular basis of Qa-1b function is unclear.		CDD:472250

It binds and presents signal peptides of classical MHC-I molecules at the cell surface and, as such, act as an indirect sensor for the normal expression of MHC-I molecules. This signal peptide dominantly accommodated in the groove of Qa-1b is called Qdm, for Qa-1 determinant modifier, and its amino acid sequence AMAPRTLLL is highly conserved among mammalian species. The Qdm/Qa-1b complex serves as a ligand for the germ-line encoded heterodimeric CD94/NKG2A receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and activated CD8+ T cells and transduces inhibitory signals to these lymphocytes. Thus, upon binding, Qa-1b signals NK cells not to engage in cell lysis. The molecular basis of Qa-1b function is unclear.		CDD:472250

tr|I0AKM4|I0AKM4_IGNAJ	pfam07675	Cleaved Adhesin Domain (Provisional)	Cleaved Adhesin Domain. This is a family of bacterial protein modules thought to function in various roles including cell adhesion, cell lysis and carbohydrate binding. A tandem repeat of these modules (either two or three repeats) constitute the haemagglutinin/adhesin (HA) regions of the gingipains, RgpA and Kgp, expressed by Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis). They form components of the major extracellular virulence complex RgpA-Kgp - a mixture of proteinases and adhesin domains. The adhesin domains in this complex are found in proteinase-cleaved forms when isolated from the cell surface. Haemagglutinin genes of P. gingivalis (hagA1 HAGA1_PORGI - and hagA2 HAGA2_PORGI) suggest that such proteins are composed of eight to ten tandem repeats of these adhesin modules. Genomic data predicts that homologous protein modules are also expressed by a number of other bacteria and form part of putative multi-domain proteins, eg. Swiss:Q26BR9 and Swiss:B0VGL6. These domains may be acting in concert with other adhesion modules thought to be part of these multi-domain proteins such as fibronectin type III, pfam00041, and Meprin, A5, mu (MAM), pfam00629, domains.

The ASH domain or N-terminal domain of abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated protein are found in proteins associated with cilia, flagella, the centrosome and the Golgi complex. The domain is also found in Hydin and OCRL whose deficiencies are associated with hydrocephalus and Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome (OCRL), respectively. The fact that Human ASPM protein carries an ASH domain indicates possible roles for ASPM in sperm flagellar or in ependymal cells' cilia. The presence of ASH in centrosomal and ciliary proteins indicates that ASPM may possess roles not only in mitotic spindle regulation, but also in ciliary and flagellar function.

tr|I3JEI9|I3JEI9_ORENI	cl11960		Immunoglobulin domain. The non-classical mouse MHC class I (MHC-I) molecule Qa-1b is a non-polymorphic MHC molecule with an important function in innate immunity. It binds and presents signal peptides of classical MHC-I molecules at the cell surface and, as such, act as an indirect sensor for the normal expression of MHC-I molecules. This signal peptide dominantly accommodated in the groove of Qa-1b is called Qdm, for Qa-1 determinant modifier, and its amino acid sequence AMAPRTLLL is highly conserved among mammalian species. The Qdm/Qa-1b complex serves as a ligand for the germ-line encoded heterodimeric CD94/NKG2A receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and activated CD8+ T cells and transduces inhibitory signals to these lymphocytes. Thus, upon binding, Qa-1b signals NK cells not to engage in cell lysis. The molecular basis of Qa-1b function is unclear.		CDD:472250

tr|K1WWL5|K1WWL5_MARBU	pfam10644	Misato Segment II tubulin-like domain (Provisional)	Misato Segment II tubulin-like domain. The misato protein contains three distinct, conserved domains, segments I, II and III. Segments I and III are common to Tubulins pfam00091, but segment II aligns with myosin heavy chain sequences from D. melanogaster (PIR C35815), rabbit (SP P04460), and human (PIR S12458). Segment II of misato is a major contributor to its greater length compared with the various tubulins. The most significant sequence similarities to this 54-amino acid region are from a motif found in the heavy chains of myosins from different organizms. A comparison of segment II with the vertebrate myosin heavy chains reveals that it is homologous to a myosin peptide in the hinge region linking the S2 and LMM domains. Segment II also contains heptad repeats which are characteriztic of the myosin tail alpha-helical coiled-coils. This myosin-like homology may be due only to the fact that both myosin and Misato carry coiled-coils, which appear similar but are not necessarily homologous (Wood V, personal communication).

This family represents the N-terminal region of the bacterial poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate polymerase (PhaC). Polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHAs) are carbon and energy reserve polymers produced in some bacteria when carbon sources are plentiful and another nutrient, such as nitrogen, phosphate, oxygen, or sulfur, becomes limiting. PHAs composed of monomeric units ranging from 3 to 14 carbons exist in nature. When the carbon source is exhausted, PHA is utilized by the bacterium. PhaC links D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyrl-CoA to an existing PHA molecule by the formation of an ester bond. This family appears to be a partial segment of an alpha/beta hydrolase domain.

Most proteins with a copy of this repeat have domains associated with membrane autotransporters (pfam03797). The repeats occur with a periodicity of 60 to 100 residues. A pattern of sequence conservation is that every second residue is well-conserved across most of the domain. These repeats as likely to have a beta-helical structure. This repeat plays a role in the efficient transport of autotransporter virulence factors to the bacterial surface during growth and infection. The repeat is always associated with the passenger domain of the autotransporter. For these reasons it has been coined the Passenger-associated Transport Repeat (PATR). The mechanism by which the PATR motif promotes transport is uncertain but it is likely that the conserved glycines (see HMM Logo) are required for flexibility of folding and that this folding drives secretion. Autotransporters that contain PATR(s) associate with distinct virulence traits such as subtilisin (S8) type protease domains and polymorphic outer-membrane protein repeats, whilst SPATE (S6) type protease and lipase-like autotransporters do not tend to contain PATR motifs.

These secretion systems derive from or have co-evolved with bacterial organelles such as ABC transporters (type I), type IV pili (type 2), flagella (type 3), or conjugative machines (type IV). The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is present in most pathogens that have contact with animals, plants, or humans. SciN is a lipoprotein tethered to the outer membrane and expressed in the periplasm of E coli and is essential for T6S-dependent secretion of the Hcp-like SciD protein and for biofilm formation.

Conserved N-terminal lysine and C-terminal asparagine with central asp/glu suggests that many of these domain may contain an isopeptide bond. In Methanothermobacter sp. CaT2, a DUF11-containing repeat hypothetical protein encoded by MTCT_1020 plays a key role as a membrane-bound adhesion protein in the aggregation of CaT2. DUF11-containing repeat domains are not involved in aggregation, but may be important for stabilizing the surface cell wall structures of CaT2.

It has been shown to be homologous to the adenylyl cyclase catalytic domain and has diguanylate cyclase activity. This observation correlates with the functional information available on two GGDEF-containing proteins, namely diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase A of Acetobacter xylinum, both of which regulate the turnover of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate. In the WspR protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the GGDEF domain acts as a diguanylate cyclase, PDB:3bre, when the whole molecule appears to form a tetramer consisting of two symmetrically-related dimers representing a biological unit. The active site is the GGD/EF motif, buried in the structure, and the cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) bind to the inhibitory-motif RxxD on the surface. The enzyme thus catalyzes the cyclization of two guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecules to one c-di-GMP molecule.		CDD:448371

This group contains the catalytic core domain of RdRp of RNA viruses belonging to the family Matonaviridae, order Hepelivirales. Members of the family Matonaviridae have a (+)ssRNA genome enclosed by an icosahedral capsid. Matonaviridae has a single genus, Rubivirus, which contains three species: Rubivirus rubella (commonly called rubella virus), Rubivirus ruteetense (commonly called ruhugu virus), and Rubivirus strelense (commonly called rustrela virus). Rubella virus (RuV) is the etiologic agent of the disease rubella (also called German measles). RuV is transmitted only between humans via the respiratory route, and is the main cause of congenital rubella syndrome (severe congenital birth defects, miscarriage, and stillbirth) when infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. In vitro studies with cell lines showed that RuV has an apoptotic effect on certain cell types; there is evidence for a p53-dependent mechanism. The RdRp domain displays a right hand with three functional subdomains, called fingers, palm, and thumb. All RdRps contain conserved polymerase motifs (A-G), located in the palm (A-E motifs) and finger (F-G) subdomains. All these motifs have been implicated in RdRp fidelity such as processes of correct incorporation and reorganization of nucleotides.		CDD:477363

tr|Q8S5S7|Q8S5S7_ORYSJ	cl40470		conserved catalytic core domain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from the positive-sense single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] viruses and closely related viruses. This group contains the catalytic core domain of RdRp of RNA viruses belonging to the family Matonaviridae, order Hepelivirales. Members of the family Matonaviridae have a (+)ssRNA genome enclosed by an icosahedral capsid. Matonaviridae has a single genus, Rubivirus, which contains three species: Rubivirus rubella (commonly called rubella virus), Rubivirus ruteetense (commonly called ruhugu virus), and Rubivirus strelense (commonly called rustrela virus). Rubella virus (RuV) is the etiologic agent of the disease rubella (also called German measles). RuV is transmitted only between humans via the respiratory route, and is the main cause of congenital rubella syndrome (severe congenital birth defects, miscarriage, and stillbirth) when infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. In vitro studies with cell lines showed that RuV has an apoptotic effect on certain cell types; there is evidence for a p53-dependent mechanism. The RdRp domain displays a right hand with three functional subdomains, called fingers, palm, and thumb. All RdRps contain conserved polymerase motifs (A-G), located in the palm (A-E motifs) and finger (F-G) subdomains. All these motifs have been implicated in RdRp fidelity such as processes of correct incorporation and reorganization of nucleotides.		CDD:477363

Compared with the D1-small domain (included in AAA, pfam00004) it lacks the long coiled-coil insertion, and instead of helix C4 contains a beta-strand (e3) that is part of a three stranded beta-pleated sheet. In Thermophilus the whole protein forms a hexamer with the D1-small and D2-small domains located on the outside of the hexamer, with the long coiled-coil being exposed on the surface. The D2-small domain is essential for oligomerization, forming a tight interface with the D2-large domain of a neighbouring subunit and thereby providing enough binding energy to stabilize the functional assembly.

The structure of BT1043 complexed with N-acetyllactosamine reveals that recognition is mediated via hydrogen bonding interactions with the reducing end of beta-N-acetylglucosamine, suggesting a role in binding glycans liberated from the mucin polypeptide. Mammalian distal gut bacteria have an expanded capacity to utilize glycans. In the absence of dietary sources, some species rely on host-derived mucosal glycans. The ability of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent human gut symbiont, to forage host glycans contributes to both its ability to persist within an individual host and its ability to be transmitted naturally to new hosts at birth.

tr|R5P4E8|R5P4E8_9BACT	pfam07980	RagB/SusD family nutrient uptake outer membrane protein	SusD family. This domain is found in bacterial cell surface proteins such SusD and SusD-like proteins as well RagB, outer membrane surface receptor antigen. Bacteroidetes, one of the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut, are Gram-negative saccharolytic microorganizms that utilize a diverse array of glycans. Hence, they express starch-utilization system (Sus) for glycan uptake. SusD has 551 amino acids, and is almost entirely alpha-helical, with 22 alpha-helices, eight of which form 4 tetra-trico peptide repeats (TPRs: helix-turn-helix motifs involved in protein-protein interactions). The four TPRs pack together to create a right-handed super-helix. This is predicted to mediate the formation of SusD and SusC porin complex at the cell surface. The interaction between SusC and TPR1/TPR2 region of SusD is predicted to be of functional importance since it allows SusD to be in position for oligosaccharide capture from other Sus lipoproteins and delivery of these glycans to the SusC porin. The non-TPR containing portion of SusD is where starch binding occurs. The binding site is a shallow surface cavity located on top of TPR1. SusD homologs such as SusD-like proteins have a critical role in carbohydrate acquisition. Both SusD and its homologs, contain 15-20 residues at the N-terminus that might be a flexible linker region, anchoring the protein to the membrane and the glycan-binding domain. Other homologs to SusD have been examined in Porphyromonas gingivalis such as RagB, an immunodominant outer-membrane surface receptor antigen. Structural characterization of RagB shows substantial similarity with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron SusD (i.e alpha-helices and TPR regions). Based on this structural similarity, functional studies suggest that, RagB binding of glycans occurs at pockets on the molecular surface that are distinct from those of SusD.

This is a family of SusD-like proteins, one member of which, BT1043, is an outer membrane lipoprotein involved in host glycan metabolism. The structures of this and SusD-homologs in the family are dominated by tetratrico peptide repeats that may facilitate association with outer membrane beta-barrel transporters required for glycan uptake. The structure of BT1043 complexed with N-acetyllactosamine reveals that recognition is mediated via hydrogen bonding interactions with the reducing end of beta-N-acetylglucosamine, suggesting a role in binding glycans liberated from the mucin polypeptide. Mammalian distal gut bacteria have an expanded capacity to utilize glycans. In the absence of dietary sources, some species rely on host-derived mucosal glycans. The ability of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent human gut symbiont, to forage host glycans contributes to both its ability to persist within an individual host and its ability to be transmitted naturally to new hosts at birth.

tr|S0GNB7|S0GNB7_9BACT	pfam07980	RagB/SusD family nutrient uptake outer membrane protein	SusD family. This domain is found in bacterial cell surface proteins such SusD and SusD-like proteins as well RagB, outer membrane surface receptor antigen. Bacteroidetes, one of the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut, are Gram-negative saccharolytic microorganizms that utilize a diverse array of glycans. Hence, they express starch-utilization system (Sus) for glycan uptake. SusD has 551 amino acids, and is almost entirely alpha-helical, with 22 alpha-helices, eight of which form 4 tetra-trico peptide repeats (TPRs: helix-turn-helix motifs involved in protein-protein interactions). The four TPRs pack together to create a right-handed super-helix. This is predicted to mediate the formation of SusD and SusC porin complex at the cell surface. The interaction between SusC and TPR1/TPR2 region of SusD is predicted to be of functional importance since it allows SusD to be in position for oligosaccharide capture from other Sus lipoproteins and delivery of these glycans to the SusC porin. The non-TPR containing portion of SusD is where starch binding occurs. The binding site is a shallow surface cavity located on top of TPR1. SusD homologs such as SusD-like proteins have a critical role in carbohydrate acquisition. Both SusD and its homologs, contain 15-20 residues at the N-terminus that might be a flexible linker region, anchoring the protein to the membrane and the glycan-binding domain. Other homologs to SusD have been examined in Porphyromonas gingivalis such as RagB, an immunodominant outer-membrane surface receptor antigen. Structural characterization of RagB shows substantial similarity with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron SusD (i.e alpha-helices and TPR regions). Based on this structural similarity, functional studies suggest that, RagB binding of glycans occurs at pockets on the molecular surface that are distinct from those of SusD.

Phosphoprotein phosphatases catalyze the reverse process.

Adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases catalyze ATP and GTP to the second messengers cAMP and cGMP, respectively, these products up-regulating catalytic activity by binding to the regulatory GAF domain(s). The opposite hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by phosphodiesterase. cGMP-dependent 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase catalyzes the conversion of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate to guanosine 5'-phosphate. Here too, cGMP regulates catalytic activity by GAF-domain binding. Phytochromes are regulatory photoreceptors in plants and bacteria which exist in two thermally-stable states that are reversibly inter-convertible by light: the Pr state absorbs maximally in the red region of the spectrum, while the Pfr state absorbs maximally in the far-red region. This domain is also found in FhlA (formate hydrogen lyase transcriptional activator) and NifA, a transcriptional activator which is required for activation of most Nif operons which are directly involved in nitrogen fixation. NifA interacts with sigma-54. This domain can bind biliverdine and phycocyanobilin (Matilla et al., FEMS Microbiology Reviews, fuab043, 45, 2021, 1. https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuab043).

tr|X5D7Q4|X5D7Q4_9BACT	cl21747		starch binding outer membrane protein SusD. This is a family of SusD-like proteins, one member of which, BT1043, is an outer membrane lipoprotein involved in host glycan metabolism. The structures of this and SusD-homologs in the family are dominated by tetratrico peptide repeats that may facilitate association with outer membrane beta-barrel transporters required for glycan uptake. The structure of BT1043 complexed with N-acetyllactosamine reveals that recognition is mediated via hydrogen bonding interactions with the reducing end of beta-N-acetylglucosamine, suggesting a role in binding glycans liberated from the mucin polypeptide. Mammalian distal gut bacteria have an expanded capacity to utilize glycans. In the absence of dietary sources, some species rely on host-derived mucosal glycans. The ability of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent human gut symbiont, to forage host glycans contributes to both its ability to persist within an individual host and its ability to be transmitted naturally to new hosts at birth.

tr|X5D7Q4|X5D7Q4_9BACT	pfam07980	RagB/SusD family nutrient uptake outer membrane protein	SusD family. This domain is found in bacterial cell surface proteins such SusD and SusD-like proteins as well RagB, outer membrane surface receptor antigen. Bacteroidetes, one of the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut, are Gram-negative saccharolytic microorganizms that utilize a diverse array of glycans. Hence, they express starch-utilization system (Sus) for glycan uptake. SusD has 551 amino acids, and is almost entirely alpha-helical, with 22 alpha-helices, eight of which form 4 tetra-trico peptide repeats (TPRs: helix-turn-helix motifs involved in protein-protein interactions). The four TPRs pack together to create a right-handed super-helix. This is predicted to mediate the formation of SusD and SusC porin complex at the cell surface. The interaction between SusC and TPR1/TPR2 region of SusD is predicted to be of functional importance since it allows SusD to be in position for oligosaccharide capture from other Sus lipoproteins and delivery of these glycans to the SusC porin. The non-TPR containing portion of SusD is where starch binding occurs. The binding site is a shallow surface cavity located on top of TPR1. SusD homologs such as SusD-like proteins have a critical role in carbohydrate acquisition. Both SusD and its homologs, contain 15-20 residues at the N-terminus that might be a flexible linker region, anchoring the protein to the membrane and the glycan-binding domain. Other homologs to SusD have been examined in Porphyromonas gingivalis such as RagB, an immunodominant outer-membrane surface receptor antigen. Structural characterization of RagB shows substantial similarity with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron SusD (i.e alpha-helices and TPR regions). Based on this structural similarity, functional studies suggest that, RagB binding of glycans occurs at pockets on the molecular surface that are distinct from those of SusD.
