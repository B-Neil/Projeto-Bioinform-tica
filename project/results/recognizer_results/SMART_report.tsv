Members include the animal dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-gated Ca2+ channel; alpha-2delta subunit, and various bacterial chemotaxis receptors. The name Cache comes from CAlcium channels and CHEmotaxis receptors. This domain consists of an N-terminal part with three predicted strands and an alpha-helix, and a C-terminal part with a strand dyad followed by a relatively unstructured region. The N-terminal portion of the (unpermuted) Cache domain contains three predicted strands that could form a sheet analogous to that present in the core of the PAS domain structure. Cache domains are particularly widespread in bacteria, with Vibrio cholerae. The animal calcium channel alpha-2delta subunits might have acquired a part of their extracellular domains from a bacterial source. The Cache domain appears to have arisen from the GAF-PAS fold despite their divergent functions.		CDD:214995	21.176	85.0	57.0	2.0	7.0	81.0	7.0	91.0	4.67e-10	47.2

Many microorganisms, such as methanogenic, acetogenic, nitrogen-fixing, photosynthetic, or sulphate-reducing bacteria, metabolise hydrogen. Hydrogen activation is mediated by a family of enzymes, termed hydrogenases, which either provide these organisms with reducing power from hydrogen oxidation, or act as electron sinks. There are two hydrogenases families that differ functionally from each other: NiFe hydrogenases tend to be more involved in hydrogen oxidation, while Iron-only FeFe (Fe only) hydrogenases in hydrogen production. Fe only hydrogenases show a common core structure, which contains a moiety, deeply buried inside the protein, with an Fe-Fe dinuclear centre, nonproteic bridging, terminal CO and CN- ligands attached to each of the iron atoms, and a dithio moiety, which also bridges the two iron atoms and has been tentatively assigned as a di(thiomethyl)amine. This common core also harbours three [4Fe-4S] iron-sulphur clusters. In FeFe hydrogenases, as in NiFe hydrogenases, the set of iron-sulphur clusters is dispersed regularly between the dinuclear Fe-Fe centre and the molecular surface. These clusters are distant by about 1.2 nm from each other but the [4Fe-4S] cluster closest to the dinuclear centre is covalently bound to one of the iron atoms though a thiolate bridging ligand. The moiety including the dinuclear centre, the thiolate bridging ligand, and the proximal [4Fe-4S] cluster is known as the H-cluster. A channel, lined with hydrophobic amino acid side chains, nearly connects the dinuclear centre and the molecular surface. Furthermore hydrogen-bonded water molecule sites have been identified at the interior and at the surface of the protein. The small subunit is comprised of alternating random coil and alpha helical structures that encompass the large subunit in a novel protein fold.

Type I chaperonins present in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts require the concerted action of 2 proteins, chaperonin 60 (cpn60) and chaperonin 10 (cpn10). The 10 kDa chaperonin (cpn10 - or groES in bacteria) exists as a ring-shaped oligomer of between six to eight identical subunits, while the 60 kDa chaperonin (cpn60 - or groEL in bacteria) forms a structure comprising 2 stacked rings, each ring containing 7 identical subunits. These ring structures assemble by self-stimulation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The central cavity of the cylindrical cpn60 tetradecamer provides as isolated environment for protein folding whilst cpn-10 binds to cpn-60 and synchronizes the release of the folded protein in an Mg2+-ATP dependent manner. The binding of cpn10 to cpn60 inhibits the weak ATPase activity of cpn60.		CDD:197951	70.968	93.0	27.0	0.0	2.0	94.0	1.0	93.0	1.51e-50	148.0

Xanthine dehydrogenase catalyses the hydrogenation of xanthine to urate, and also requires FAD, molybdenum and two 2FE-2S clusters as cofactors. This activity is often found in a bifunctional enzyme with xanthine oxidase activity too. The enzyme can be converted from the dehydrogenase form to the oxidase form irreversibly by proteolysis or reversibly through oxidation of sulphydryl groups.

The N-terminal regions of RAV1 and RAV2 are homologous to the AP2 DNA-binding domain (see ) present in a family of transcription factors, while the C-terminal region exhibits homology to the highly conserved C-terminal domain, designated B3, of VP1/ABI3 transcription factors. The AP2 and B3-like domains of RAV1 bind autonomously to the CAACA and CACCTG motifs, respectively, and together achieve a high affinity and specificity of binding. It has been suggested that the AP2 and B3-like domains of RAV1 are connected by a highly flexible structure enabling the two domains to bind to the CAACA and CACCTG motifs in various spacings and orientations.

tr|E8N4R7|E8N4R7_ANATU	smart00889	Elongation factor G, domain IV	Elongation factor G, domain IV. Translation elongation factors are responsible for two main processes during protein synthesis on the ribosome. EF1A (or EF-Tu) is responsible for the selection and binding of the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site (acceptor site) of the ribosome. EF2 (or EF-G) is responsible for the translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site (peptidyl-tRNA site) of the ribosome, thereby freeing the A-site for the next aminoacyl-tRNA to bind. Elongation factors are responsible for achieving accuracy of translation and both EF1A and EF2 are remarkably conserved throughout evolution. Elongation factor EF2 (EF-G) is a G-protein. It brings about the translocation of peptidyl-tRNA and mRNA through a ratchet-like mechanism: the binding of GTP-EF2 to the ribosome causes a counter-clockwise rotation in the small ribosomal subunit; the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by EF2 and the subsequent release of EF2 causes a clockwise rotation of the small subunit back to the starting position. This twisting action destabilises tRNA-ribosome interactions, freeing the tRNA to translocate along the ribosome upon GTP-hydrolysis by EF2. EF2 binding also affects the entry and exit channel openings for the mRNA, widening it when bound to enable the mRNA to translocate along the ribosome. EF2 has five domains. This entry represents domain IV found in EF2 (or EF-G) of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The EF2-GTP-ribosome complex undergoes extensive structural rearrangement for tRNA-mRNA movement to occur. Domain IV, which extends from the 'body' of the EF2 molecule much like a lever arm, appears to be essential for the structural transition to take place.

Compared with the D1-small domain (included in AAA) it lacks the long coiled-coil insertion, and instead of helix C4 contains a beta-strand (e3) that is part of a three stranded beta-pleated sheet. In Thermophilus the whole protein forms a hexamer with the D1-small and D2-small domains located on the outside of the hexamer, with the long coiled-coil being exposed on the surface. The D2-small domain is essential for oligomerisation, forming a tight interface with the D2-large domain of a neighbouring subunit and thereby providing enough binding energy to stabilise the functional assembly.

CBS domains are small intracellular modules that pair together to form a stable globular domain. This family represents a single CBS domain. Pairs of these domains have been termed a Bateman domain. CBS domains have been shown to bind ligands with an adenosyl group such as AMP, ATP and S-AdoMet. CBS domains are found attached to a wide range of other protein domains suggesting that CBS domains may play a regulatory role making proteins sensitive to adenosyl carrying ligands. The region containing the CBS domains in Cystathionine-beta synthase is involved in regulation by S-AdoMet. CBS domain pairs from AMPK bind AMP or ATP. The CBS domains from IMPDH and the chloride channel CLC2 bind ATP.		CDD:449531

tr|F4BWT9|F4BWT9_METSG	cl15354		Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains superfamily. CBS domains are small intracellular modules that pair together to form a stable globular domain. This family represents a single CBS domain. Pairs of these domains have been termed a Bateman domain. CBS domains have been shown to bind ligands with an adenosyl group such as AMP, ATP and S-AdoMet. CBS domains are found attached to a wide range of other protein domains suggesting that CBS domains may play a regulatory role making proteins sensitive to adenosyl carrying ligands. The region containing the CBS domains in Cystathionine-beta synthase is involved in regulation by S-AdoMet. CBS domain pairs from AMPK bind AMP or ATP. The CBS domains from IMPDH and the chloride channel CLC2 bind ATP.		CDD:449531										
tr|F4BX03|F4BX03_METSG	smart00788	Adenylosuccinate synthetase	Adenylosuccinate synthetase. Adenylosuccinate synthetase plays an important role in purine biosynthesis, by catalyzing the GTP-dependent conversion of IMP and aspartic acid to AMP. Adenylosuccinate synthetase has been characterized from various sources ranging from Escherichia coli (gene purA) to vertebrate tissues. In vertebrates, two isozymes are present - one involved in purine biosynthesis and the other in the purine nucleotide cycle. The crystal structure of adenylosuccinate synthetase from E. coli reveals that the dominant structural element of each monomer of the homodimer is a central beta-sheet of 10 strands. The first nine strands of the sheet are mutually parallel with right-handed crossover connections between the strands. The 10th strand is antiparallel with respect to the first nine strands. In addition, the enzyme has two antiparallel beta-sheets, comprised of two strands and three strands each, 11 alpha-helices and two short 3/10-helices. Further, it has been suggested that the similarities in the GTP-binding domains of the synthetase and the p21ras protein are an example of convergent evolution of two distinct families of GTP-binding proteins. Structures of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Triticum aestivum and Arabidopsis thaliana when compared with the known structures from E. coli reveals that the overall fold is very similar to that of the E. coli protein.

Transketolase (TK) catalyzes the reversible transfer of a two-carbon ketol unit from xylulose 5-phosphate to an aldose receptor, such as ribose 5-phosphate, to form sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate. This enzyme, together with transaldolase, provides a link between the glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways. TK requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor. In most sources where TK has been purified, it is a homodimer of approximately 70 Kd subunits. TK sequences from a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources show that the enzyme has been evolutionarily conserved. In the peroxisomes of methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha, there is a highly related enzyme, dihydroxy-acetone synthase (DHAS) (also known as formaldehyde transketolase), which exhibits a very unusual specificity by including formaldehyde amongst its substrates.

Many microorganisms, such as methanogenic, acetogenic, nitrogen-fixing, photosynthetic, or sulphate-reducing bacteria, metabolise hydrogen. Hydrogen activation is mediated by a family of enzymes, termed hydrogenases, which either provide these organisms with reducing power from hydrogen oxidation, or act as electron sinks. There are two hydrogenases families that differ functionally from each other: NiFe hydrogenases tend to be more involved in hydrogen oxidation, while Iron-only FeFe (Fe only) hydrogenases in hydrogen production. Fe only hydrogenases show a common core structure, which contains a moiety, deeply buried inside the protein, with an Fe-Fe dinuclear centre, nonproteic bridging, terminal CO and CN- ligands attached to each of the iron atoms, and a dithio moiety, which also bridges the two iron atoms and has been tentatively assigned as a di(thiomethyl)amine. This common core also harbours three [4Fe-4S] iron-sulphur clusters. In FeFe hydrogenases, as in NiFe hydrogenases, the set of iron-sulphur clusters is dispersed regularly between the dinuclear Fe-Fe centre and the molecular surface. These clusters are distant by about 1.2 nm from each other but the [4Fe-4S] cluster closest to the dinuclear centre is covalently bound to one of the iron atoms though a thiolate bridging ligand. The moiety including the dinuclear centre, the thiolate bridging ligand, and the proximal [4Fe-4S] cluster is known as the H-cluster. A channel, lined with hydrophobic amino acid side chains, nearly connects the dinuclear centre and the molecular surface. Furthermore hydrogen-bonded water molecule sites have been identified at the interior and at the surface of the protein.

tr|Q3A458|Q3A458_SYNC1	smart00902	Iron hydrogenase small subunit	Iron hydrogenase small subunit. Many microorganisms, such as methanogenic, acetogenic, nitrogen-fixing, photosynthetic, or sulphate-reducing bacteria, metabolise hydrogen. Hydrogen activation is mediated by a family of enzymes, termed hydrogenases, which either provide these organisms with reducing power from hydrogen oxidation, or act as electron sinks. There are two hydrogenases families that differ functionally from each other: NiFe hydrogenases tend to be more involved in hydrogen oxidation, while Iron-only FeFe (Fe only) hydrogenases in hydrogen production. Fe only hydrogenases show a common core structure, which contains a moiety, deeply buried inside the protein, with an Fe-Fe dinuclear centre, nonproteic bridging, terminal CO and CN- ligands attached to each of the iron atoms, and a dithio moiety, which also bridges the two iron atoms and has been tentatively assigned as a di(thiomethyl)amine. This common core also harbours three [4Fe-4S] iron-sulphur clusters. In FeFe hydrogenases, as in NiFe hydrogenases, the set of iron-sulphur clusters is dispersed regularly between the dinuclear Fe-Fe centre and the molecular surface. These clusters are distant by about 1.2 nm from each other but the [4Fe-4S] cluster closest to the dinuclear centre is covalently bound to one of the iron atoms though a thiolate bridging ligand.

This observation correlates with the functional information available on two GGDEF-containing proteins, namely diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase A of Acetobacter xylinum, both of which regulate the turnover of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate. In the WspR protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the GGDEF domain acts as a diguanylate cyclase, PDB:3bre, when the whole molecule appears to form a tetramer consisting of two symmetrically-related dimers representing a biological unit. The active site is the GGD/EF motif, buried in the structure, and the cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) bind to the inhibitory-motif RxxD on the surface. The enzyme thus catalyzes the cyclization of two guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecules to one c-di-GMP molecule.		CDD:448371

tr|X1MNW3|X1MNW3_9ZZZZ	cl22861		N/A. The Clostridium neurotoxin family is composed of tetanus neurotoxin and seven serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin. The structure of the botulinum neurotoxin reveals a four domain protein. The N-terminal catalytic domain (pfam01742), the central translocation domains and two receptor binding domains. This domains is the N-terminal receptor binding domain,which is comprised of two seven-stranded beta-sheets sandwiched together to form a jelly role motif. The role of this domain in receptor binding appears to be indirect.		CDD:473984
