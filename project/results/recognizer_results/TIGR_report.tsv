In the case of UniProt:P80064, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase catalyzes the formation of homogentisate from 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and the pyruvate part of the HPPD substrate (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate), derived from L-tyrosine, and the O2 molecule occupy the three free coordination sites of the catalytic iron atom in the C-terminal domain.

The alpha chain contains domains for molybdopterin dinucleotide binding and molybdopterin oxidoreductase (pfam01568 and pfam00384, respectively). The holo-enzyme also contains beta and gamma subunits of 32 and 20 kDa. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of formate (produced from pyruvate during anaerobic growth) to carbon dioxide with the concomitant release of two electrons and two protons. The electrons are utilized mainly in the nitrate respiration by nitrate reductase. In E. coli and Salmonella, there are two forms of the formate dehydrogenase, one induced by nitrate which is strictly anaerobic (fdn), and one incuced during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth (fdo). This subunit is one of only three proteins in E. coli which contain selenocysteine. This model is well-defined, with a large, unpopulated trusted/noise gap.

Sulfite reductase is a multisubunit enzyme composed of dimers of either alpha/beta or alpha/beta/gamma subunits, each containing a siroheme and iron sulfur cluster prosthetic center. Found in sulfate-reducing bacteria, these genes are commonly located in an unidirectional gene cluster. This model describes the beta subunit of sulfite reductase.

This model models orthologs of translation elongation factor EF-Tu in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, one of several GTP-binding translation factors found by the more general pfam model GTP_EFTU. The eukaryotic conterpart, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (eEF-1 alpha), is excluded from this model. EF-Tu is one of the most abundant proteins in bacteria, as well as one of the most highly conserved, and in a number of species the gene is duplicated with identical function. When bound to GTP, EF-Tu can form a complex with any (correctly) aminoacylated tRNA except those for initiation and for selenocysteine, in which case EF-Tu is replaced by other factors. Transfer RNA is carried to the ribosome in these complexes for protein translation. [Protein synthesis, Translation factors]		CDD:129576	Bacteria	2	82.071	396.0	69.0	1.0	1.0	396.0	1.0	394.0	0.0	728.0

Most fall into two large classes. One class consists of long proteins in which two classes of repeats are abundant: an FG-GAP repeat (pfam01839) class, and an RHS repeat (pfam05593) or YD repeat (TIGR01643). This class includes secreted bacterial insecticidal toxins and intercellular signalling proteins such as the teneurins in animals. The other class consists of uncharacterized proteins shorter than 400 amino acids, where this core domain of about 75 amino acids tends to occur in the N-terminal half. Over twenty such proteins are found in Pseudomonas putida alone; little sequence similarity or repeat structure is found among these proteins outside the region modeled by this domain.

The OapA protein is required for efficient nasopharyngeal mucosal colonization, and its expression is associated with a distinctive transparent colony phenotype. OapA is thought to be a secreted protein, and its expression exhibits high-frequency phase variation. The OapA domain has been shown to bind to peptidoglycan in the E. coli protein YtfB.

This model represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Forms exist which utilize NAD (EC 1.2.1.12), NADP (EC 1.2.1.13) or either (1.2.1.59). In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilizing forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively. Two Pfam models cover the two functional domains of this protein; pfam00044 represents the N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain and pfam02800 represents the C-terminal catalytic domain. An additional form of gap gene is found in gamma proteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gamma-proteobacteria. This enzyme is described by TIGR001532. These sequences generally score between trusted and noise to this GAPDH model due to the close evolutionary relationship. There exists the possiblity that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to posess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity). There are a great number of sequences in the databases which score between trusted and noise to this model, nearly all of them due to fragmentary sequences. It seems that study of this gene has been carried out in many species utilizing PCR probes which exclude the extreme ends of the consenses used to define this model. The noise level is set relative not to E4PD, but the next closest outliers, the class II GAPDH's (found in archaea, TIGR01546) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH, TIGR01296) both of which have highest-scoring hits around -225 to the prior model.

Of the two PqqE homologs of the cassette, this family is the closer in sequence.		CDD:211973	cellular organisms	131567	28.667	150.0	96.0	6.0	63.0	203.0	7.0	154.0	3.66e-11	60.6

One of several pathways of tryptophan degradation is as follows: tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (1.13.11.11) uses 02 to convert Trp to L-formylkynurenine. Arylformamidase (3.5.1.9) hydrolyzes the product to L-kynurenine and formate. Kynureninase (3.7.1.3) hydrolyzes L-kynurenine to anthranilate plus alanine. Members of the seed alignment for this model are bacterial predicted metal-dependent hydrolases. All are supported as arylformamidase (3.5.1.9) by an operon structure in which kynureninase and/or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase genes are adjacent. The members from Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ralstonia metallidurans were characterized. An example from Pseudomonas fluorescens is given the gene symbol qbsH instead of kynB because of its role in quinolobactin biosynthesis, which begins with tryptophan. All members of this family should be arylformamidase (3.5.1.9). [Energy metabolism, Amino acids and amines]		CDD:469937

tr|B5YFG4|B5YFG4_DICT6	TIGR01534	type I glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase	glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, type I. This model represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Forms exist which utilize NAD (EC 1.2.1.12), NADP (EC 1.2.1.13) or either (1.2.1.59). In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilizing forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively. Two Pfam models cover the two functional domains of this protein; pfam00044 represents the N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain and pfam02800 represents the C-terminal catalytic domain. An additional form of gap gene is found in gamma proteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gamma-proteobacteria. This enzyme is described by TIGR001532. These sequences generally score between trusted and noise to this GAPDH model due to the close evolutionary relationship. There exists the possiblity that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to posess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity). There are a great number of sequences in the databases which score between trusted and noise to this model, nearly all of them due to fragmentary sequences. It seems that study of this gene has been carried out in many species utilizing PCR probes which exclude the extreme ends of the consenses used to define this model. The noise level is set relative not to E4PD, but the next closest outliers, the class II GAPDH's (found in archaea, TIGR01546) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH, TIGR01296) both of which have highest-scoring hits around -225 to the prior model.

This model represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Forms exist which utilize NAD (EC 1.2.1.12), NADP (EC 1.2.1.13) or either (1.2.1.59). In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilizing forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively. Two Pfam models cover the two functional domains of this protein; pfam00044 represents the N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain and pfam02800 represents the C-terminal catalytic domain. An additional form of gap gene is found in gamma proteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gamma-proteobacteria. This enzyme is described by TIGR001532. These sequences generally score between trusted and noise to this GAPDH model due to the close evolutionary relationship. There exists the possiblity that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to posess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity). There are a great number of sequences in the databases which score between trusted and noise to this model, nearly all of them due to fragmentary sequences. It seems that study of this gene has been carried out in many species utilizing PCR probes which exclude the extreme ends of the consenses used to define this model. The noise level is set relative not to E4PD, but the next closest outliers, the class II GAPDH's (found in archaea, TIGR01546) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH, TIGR01296) both of which have highest-scoring hits around -225 to the prior model.

The similarity between the PGF motif in this domain and in the PGF-CTERM domain is highly suggestive.

All these genomes also include a fusion protein (TIGR04557) whose domains resemble SoxY and SoxZ from thiosulfate oxidation. A conserved Cys in this fusion protein aligns to the Cys residue in SoxY that carries sulfur cycle intermediates. In many genomes, the genes for PQQ biosynthesis enzymes, PQQ-dependent enzymes, their associated cytochromes, and members of this family are clustered.

This model represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Forms exist which utilize NAD (EC 1.2.1.12), NADP (EC 1.2.1.13) or either (1.2.1.59). In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilizing forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively. Two Pfam models cover the two functional domains of this protein; pfam00044 represents the N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain and pfam02800 represents the C-terminal catalytic domain. An additional form of gap gene is found in gamma proteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gamma-proteobacteria. This enzyme is described by TIGR001532. These sequences generally score between trusted and noise to this GAPDH model due to the close evolutionary relationship. There exists the possiblity that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to posess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity). There are a great number of sequences in the databases which score between trusted and noise to this model, nearly all of them due to fragmentary sequences. It seems that study of this gene has been carried out in many species utilizing PCR probes which exclude the extreme ends of the consenses used to define this model. The noise level is set relative not to E4PD, but the next closest outliers, the class II GAPDH's (found in archaea, TIGR01546) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH, TIGR01296) both of which have highest-scoring hits around -225 to the prior model.

The genes represented by this model are always found in association with a neighboring gene for a beta subunit (TIGR02177) which also occurs in a 4-subunit (alpha/beta/gamma/ferredoxin) version of the system. This alpha/gamma plus beta structure was used to define the set of sequences to include in this model.

The enzyme from Sulfolobus has been characterized with respect to its substrate specificity, which is described as wide, encompassing various 2-oxoacids such as 2-oxoglutarate, 2-oxobutyrate and pyruvate. The enzyme from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus has been shown to have a high specificity towards 2-oxoglutarate and is one of the key enzymes in the reverse TCA cycle in this organism. Furthermore, considering its binding of coenzyme A, it can be reasonably inferred that the product of the reaction is succinyl-CoA. The genes for this enzyme in Prevotella intermedia 17, Persephonella marina EX-H1 and Picrophilus torridus DSM 9790 are in close proximity to a variety of TCA cycle genes. Persephonella marina and P. torridus are believed to encode complete TCA cycles, and none of these contains the lipoate-based 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1/E2/E3) system.

This GlmM protein catalyzes the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate. The first-characterized bacterial GlmM protein is modeled by TIGR01455. These two families are members of the larger phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase family (characterized by three domains: pfam02878, pfam02879 and pfam02880), but are not nearest neighbors to each other. This model also includes a number of sequences from non-archaea in the Bacteroides, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Spirochaetes lineages. Evidence supporting their inclusion in this equivalog as having the same activity comes from genomic context and phylogenetic profiling. A large number of these organisms are known to produce exo-polysaccharide and yet only appeared to contain the GlmS enzyme of the GlmSMU pathway for UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (GenProp0750). In some organisms including Leptospira, this archaeal GlmM is found adjacent to the GlmS as well as a putative GlmU non-orthologous homolog. Phylogenetic profiling of the GlmS-only pattern using PPP identifies members of this archaeal GlmM family as the highest-scoring result.

Every member of this clade is from a genome which possesses most of the lysine biosynthesis pathway but lacks any of the known aminotransferases, succinylases, desuccinylases, acetylases or deacetylases typical of the acylated versions of this pathway nor do they have the direct, NADPH-dependent enzyme (ddh). Although there is no experimental characterization of any of the sequences in this clade, a direct pathway is known in plants and Chlamydia and the clade containing the Chlamydia gene is a neighboring one in the same pfam00155 superfamily so it seems quite reasonable that these enzymes catalyze the same transformation.	2.6.1.83	CDD:274638	cellular organisms	131567	34.188	351.0	228.0	3.0	48.0	396.0	32.0	381.0	3.3e-92	279.0

The genes represented by this model are always found in association with a neighboring gene for a beta subunit (TIGR02177) which also occurs in a 4-subunit (alpha/beta/gamma/ferredoxin) version of the system. This alpha/gamma plus beta structure was used to define the set of sequences to include in this model. This pair of genes is not consistantly observed in proximity to any electron acceptor genes, but is found next to putative ferredoxins or ferredoxin-domain proteins in Azoarcus sp.

Other potential acceptors are also sporadically observed in close proximity including ferritin-like proteins, reberythrin, peroxiredoxin and a variety of other flavin and iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins. The phylogenetic distribution of this family encompasses archaea, a number of deeply-branching bacterial clades and only a small number of firmicutes and proteobacteria. The enzyme from Sulfolobus has been characterized with respect to its substrate specificity, which is described as wide, encompassing various 2-oxoacids such as 2-oxoglutarate, 2-oxobutyrate and pyruvate. The enzyme from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus has been shown to have a high specificity towards 2-oxoglutarate and is one of the key enzymes in the reverse TCA cycle in this organism. Furthermore, considering its binding of coenzyme A, it can be reasonably inferred that the product of the reaction is succinyl-CoA. The genes for this enzyme in Prevotella intermedia 17, Persephonella marina EX-H1 and Picrophilus torridus DSM 9790 are in close proximity to a variety of TCA cycle genes. Persephonella marina and P. torridus are believed to encode complete TCA cycles, and none of these contains the lipoate-based 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (E1/E2/E3) system. That system is presumed to be replaced by this one. In fact, the lipoate system is absent in most organisms possessing a member of this family, providing additional circumstantial evidence that many of these enzymes are capable of acting as 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases and		CDD:274738	cellular organisms	131567	33.777	376.0	204.0	13.0	5.0	343.0	195.0	562.0	2.29e-76	242.0

Methanogenic archaea contain three closely related homologs of the 2-isopropylmalate synthases (LeuA) represented by TIGR00973. Two of these in Methanococcus janaschii (MJ1392 - CimA; MJ0503 - AksA) have been characterized as catalyzing alternative reactions leaving the third (MJ1195) as the presumptive LeuA enzyme. CimA is citramalate (2-methylmalate) synthase which condenses acetyl-CoA with pyruvate. This enzyme is believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of isoleucine in methanogens and possibly other species lacking threonine dehydratase. AksA is a homocitrate synthase which also produces (homo)2-citrate and (homo)3-citrate in the biosynthesis of Coenzyme B which is restricted solely to methanogenic archaea. Methanogens, then should and aparrently do contain all three of these enzymes. Unfortunately, phylogenetic trees do not resolve into three unambiguous clades, making assignment of function to particular genes problematic. Other archaea which lack a threonine dehydratase (mainly Euryarchaeota) should contain both a CimA and a LeuA gene. This is true of, for example, archaeoglobus fulgidis, but not for the Pyrococci which have none in this clade, but one in TIGR00973 and one in TIGRT00977 which may fulfill these roles. Other species which have only one hit to this model and lack threonine dehydratase are very likely LeuA enzymes.		CDD:273964	Archaea	2157	55.342	365.0	161.0	1.0	20.0	384.0	1.0	363.0	2.66e-164	467.0

Class II enzymes are found primarily in prokaryotes and Archaeoglobus fulgidus and are soluble as they lack the membrane region. Enzymes catalyze the synthesis of coenzyme A and mevalonate in isoprenoid synthesis. Bacteria, such as Pseudomonas mevalonii, which rely solely on mevalonate for their carbon source, catalyze the reverse reaction, using an NAD-dependent HMGR to deacetylate mevalonate into 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA.

An enzyme from Pseudomonas fluorescens involved in the biosynthesis of the polyketide diacetyl-phloroglucinol is more closely related, but lacks the active site residues. In each of the genomes containing a member of this family there is no other recognized HMG-CoA synthase, although other elements of the mevalonate pathway are in evidence.

TRAP-T (Tripartite ATP-independent Periplasmic Transporter) family proteins generally consist of three components, and these systems have so far been found in Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-postive bacteria and archaea. The best characterized example is the DctPQM system of Rhodobacter capsulatus, a C4 dicarboxylate (malate, fumarate, succinate) transporter. This model represents the DctP family, one of at least three major families of extracytoplasmic solute receptor for TRAP family transporters.

tr|F4XG17|F4XG17_9FIRM	TIGR01534	type I glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase	glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, type I. This model represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Forms exist which utilize NAD (EC 1.2.1.12), NADP (EC 1.2.1.13) or either (1.2.1.59). In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilizing forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively. Two Pfam models cover the two functional domains of this protein; pfam00044 represents the N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain and pfam02800 represents the C-terminal catalytic domain. An additional form of gap gene is found in gamma proteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gamma-proteobacteria. This enzyme is described by TIGR001532. These sequences generally score between trusted and noise to this GAPDH model due to the close evolutionary relationship. There exists the possiblity that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to posess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity). There are a great number of sequences in the databases which score between trusted and noise to this model, nearly all of them due to fragmentary sequences. It seems that study of this gene has been carried out in many species utilizing PCR probes which exclude the extreme ends of the consenses used to define this model. The noise level is set relative not to E4PD, but the next closest outliers, the class II GAPDH's (found in archaea, TIGR01546) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH, TIGR01296) both of which have highest-scoring hits around -225 to the prior model.

This is achieved by two enzymes (crtP and crtQ) in cyanobacteria (Gloeobacter being an exception) and plants, but by a single enzyme in most other bacteria and in fungi. This single enzyme is called the bacterial-type phytoene desaturase, or CrtI.

The alpha chain contains domains for molybdopterin dinucleotide binding and molybdopterin oxidoreductase (pfam01568 and pfam00384, respectively). The holo-enzyme also contains beta and gamma subunits. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of formate (produced from pyruvate during anaerobic growth) to carbon dioxide with the concomitant release of two electrons and two protons. The enzyme's purpose is to allow growth on formate in some circumstances and, in the case of FdhH in gamma proteobacteria, to pass electrons to hydrogenase (by which process acid is neutralized).

The holo-enzyme also contains beta and gamma subunits of 32 and 20 kDa. The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of formate (produced from pyruvate during anaerobic growth) to carbon dioxide with the concomitant release of two electrons and two protons. The electrons are utilized mainly in the nitrate respiration by nitrate reductase. In E. coli and Salmonella, there are two forms of the formate dehydrogenase, one induced by nitrate which is strictly anaerobic (fdn), and one incuced during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth (fdo). This subunit is one of only three proteins in E. coli which contain selenocysteine. This model is well-defined, with a large, unpopulated trusted/noise gap.

The eukaryotic conterpart, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (eEF-1 alpha), is excluded from this model. EF-Tu is one of the most abundant proteins in bacteria, as well as one of the most highly conserved, and in a number of species the gene is duplicated with identical function.

tr|I0UVT1|I0UVT1_9MICC	TIGR01534	type I glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase	glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, type I. This model represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Forms exist which utilize NAD (EC 1.2.1.12), NADP (EC 1.2.1.13) or either (1.2.1.59). In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilizing forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively. Two Pfam models cover the two functional domains of this protein; pfam00044 represents the N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain and pfam02800 represents the C-terminal catalytic domain. An additional form of gap gene is found in gamma proteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gamma-proteobacteria. This enzyme is described by TIGR001532. These sequences generally score between trusted and noise to this GAPDH model due to the close evolutionary relationship. There exists the possiblity that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to posess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity). There are a great number of sequences in the databases which score between trusted and noise to this model, nearly all of them due to fragmentary sequences. It seems that study of this gene has been carried out in many species utilizing PCR probes which exclude the extreme ends of the consenses used to define this model. The noise level is set relative not to E4PD, but the next closest outliers, the class II GAPDH's (found in archaea, TIGR01546) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH, TIGR01296) both of which have highest-scoring hits around -225 to the prior model.

An enzyme from Pseudomonas fluorescens involved in the biosynthesis of the polyketide diacetyl-phloroglucinol is more closely related, but lacks the active site residues. In each of the genomes containing a member of this family there is no other recognized HMG-CoA synthase, although other elements of the mevalonate pathway are in evidence. The only archaeon currently sequenced which lacks a homolog in this pathway is Halobacterium, which _does_ contain a separate HMG-CoA synthase. Thus, although there is no experimental evidence supporting this name, the bioinformatics-based conclusion appears to be sound.

This family consists of a set proteins various designated DegP, heat shock protein HtrA, and protease DO. The ortholog in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is designated MucD and is found in an operon that controls mucoid phenotype. This family also includes the DegQ (HhoA) paralog in E. coli which can rescue a DegP mutant, but not the smaller DegS paralog, which cannot. Members of this family are located in the periplasm and have separable functions as both protease and chaperone. Members have a trypsin domain and two copies of a PDZ domain. This protein protects bacteria from thermal and other stresses and may be important for the survival of bacterial pathogens.// The chaperone function is dominant at low temperatures, whereas the proteolytic activity is turned on at elevated temperatures.

SMC was shown (in Caulobacter crescentus) to be induced early in S phase but present and bound to DNA throughout the cell cycle.

Characterized members of this family include a surface-located pullulanase from Streptococcus pneumoniae () and an extracellular bifunctional amylase/pullulanase with C-terminal pullulanase activity (.	3.2.1.41	CDD:273973	Bacilli	91061	29.197	137.0	57.0	5.0	508.0	616.0	477.0	601.0	2.78e-06	49.5
tr|R5AJ49|R5AJ49_9CLOT	TIGR01534	type I glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase	glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, type I. This model represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Forms exist which utilize NAD (EC 1.2.1.12), NADP (EC 1.2.1.13) or either (1.2.1.59). In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilizing forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively. Two Pfam models cover the two functional domains of this protein; pfam00044 represents the N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain and pfam02800 represents the C-terminal catalytic domain. An additional form of gap gene is found in gamma proteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gamma-proteobacteria. This enzyme is described by TIGR001532. These sequences generally score between trusted and noise to this GAPDH model due to the close evolutionary relationship. There exists the possiblity that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to posess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity). There are a great number of sequences in the databases which score between trusted and noise to this model, nearly all of them due to fragmentary sequences. It seems that study of this gene has been carried out in many species utilizing PCR probes which exclude the extreme ends of the consenses used to define this model. The noise level is set relative not to E4PD, but the next closest outliers, the class II GAPDH's (found in archaea, TIGR01546) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH, TIGR01296) both of which have highest-scoring hits around -225 to the prior model.

EF-Tu is one of the most abundant proteins in bacteria, as well as one of the most highly conserved, and in a number of species the gene is duplicated with identical function.

This model represents glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the enzyme responsible for the interconversion of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Forms exist which utilize NAD (EC 1.2.1.12), NADP (EC 1.2.1.13) or either (1.2.1.59). In some species, NAD- and NADP- utilizing forms exist, generally being responsible for reactions in the anabolic and catabolic directions respectively. Two Pfam models cover the two functional domains of this protein; pfam00044 represents the N-terminal NAD(P)-binding domain and pfam02800 represents the C-terminal catalytic domain. An additional form of gap gene is found in gamma proteobacteria and is responsible for the conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to 4-phospho-erythronate in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine. This pathway of pyridoxine biosynthesis appears to be limited, however, to a relatively small number of bacterial species although it is prevalent among the gamma-proteobacteria. This enzyme is described by TIGR001532. These sequences generally score between trusted and noise to this GAPDH model due to the close evolutionary relationship. There exists the possiblity that some forms of GAPDH may be bifunctional and act on E4P in species which make pyridoxine and via hydroxythreonine and lack a separate E4PDH enzyme (for instance, the GAPDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to posess a limited E4PD activity as well as a robust GAPDH activity). There are a great number of sequences in the databases which score between trusted and noise to this model, nearly all of them due to fragmentary sequences. It seems that study of this gene has been carried out in many species utilizing PCR probes which exclude the extreme ends of the consenses used to define this model. The noise level is set relative not to E4PD, but the next closest outliers, the class II GAPDH's (found in archaea, TIGR01546) and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH, TIGR01296) both of which have highest-scoring hits around -225 to the prior model.

tr|X1KKM0|X1KKM0_9ZZZZ	cl38939		N/A. The MMP1680 protein from Methanococcus maripaludis has been characterized as the archaeal protein responsible for the second step of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis. This GlmM protein catalyzes the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate. The first-characterized bacterial GlmM protein is modeled by TIGR01455. These two families are members of the larger phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase family (characterized by three domains: pfam02878, pfam02879 and pfam02880), but are not nearest neighbors to each other. This model also includes a number of sequences from non-archaea in the Bacteroides, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Spirochaetes lineages. Evidence supporting their inclusion in this equivalog as having the same activity comes from genomic context and phylogenetic profiling. A large number of these organisms are known to produce exo-polysaccharide and yet only appeared to contain the GlmS enzyme of the GlmSMU pathway for UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis (GenProp0750). In some organisms including Leptospira, this archaeal GlmM is found adjacent to the GlmS as well as a putative GlmU non-orthologous homolog. Phylogenetic profiling of the GlmS-only pattern using PPP identifies members of this archaeal GlmM family as the highest-scoring result.
